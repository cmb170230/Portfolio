I've been tasked with bringing the hors doeuvres for this fancy party I'm going to but the only proper dish I'm familiar with that fits that description are deviled eggs. Unfortunately, the host is vegan so those are a no go (even though I think they're delicious). Do you have anything that could work for my situation?

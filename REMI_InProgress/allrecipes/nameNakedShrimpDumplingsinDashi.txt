Had it for a party and everyone was very disappointed with dumplings flavor and texture.\n\nIf are going to make it, try reworking the recipe first. I would also work on the texture profile to give a more diverse mouth feel."

All these years I have been way too skimpy adding the bonito flakes. That problem is now solved. My family can now enjoy a proper serving of dashi and miso soup.\nSo glad I tried this!"

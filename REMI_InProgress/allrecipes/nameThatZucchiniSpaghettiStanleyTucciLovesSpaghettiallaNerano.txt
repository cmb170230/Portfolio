"reviewBody": "Excellent flavor and mouth feel, but was extremely heavy in the stomach due to deep frying, zucchini to pasta ratio seemed a smidge too high, and it took a really long time to fry all of that zucchini, which needs to be deep brown in order to achieve necessary flavor &amp; texture. I can usually get a great caramelization when grilling zucchini so next time, I will cut zucchini in lengthwise strips, toss with some olive oil, and grill in that first step. I would also reduce zucchinis used - maybe 3 zucchinis to every 4 oz. of pasta."

"reviewBody": "Was very excited to make this recipe - simple ingredients and it looked amazing. It's a great way to use up abundant zucchini that grows in the area. The good - this dish is not too \"saucy,\" there is a mild, smokey-sweet flavor from the caramelized zucchini. The meh - we don't have a large deep fryer, so it took a while to make - it was batch after batch to get all the slices from the six zucchinis caramelized. Were we to do this again, we'd probably try the air fryer or skillet as it would be the same amount of effort and would waste less oil. However, for all the effort, we didn't love the mildness of the dish. This one is all about the mellow, understated flavors of the caramelized zucchini. Glad we tried it, but probably won't make it again."

"reviewBody": "First, this recipe on FlipBoard called for 1 zucchini per person. 6 for 2 seems excessive as I can imagine it would overwhelm the pasta., and laborious to fry up. My husband and I both loved this! A taste of a Italy at home. - The zucchini had a wonderful touch of smoky flavor to it. My husband asked if there were mushrooms in it. - I fried with not much olive oil (did not use safflower as said in recipe). As someone else said you don’t really need more as the oils comes out of the zucchini when you cook it up next day. So if you do this way, I’d use olive oil for initial frying. - Rather than salt, I added caper juice. - I grated parm in the sauce and then some on top. - Instead of butter I used Melt butter."

"reviewBody": "I've made this a few times, and the recipe as written is incredibly good -- but I did find a way to make it a bit more healthy and a LOT easier: use a very large nonstick pan and coat it with a healthy spray of olive oil flavored Pam spray (or similar). Over high heat, put the zucchini in a single layer (VERY important) in the pan and cook until deep brown (it took me about 7 minutes for the first side and about 5 for the second). All stoves are different, so just keep an eye on it until you get the hang of it. Before flipping, give the uncooked sides another spray of the Pam. After all batches are done, proceed as described in the recipe. The results from this method are indistinguishable from deep frying, but your gall bladder and your butt will thank you :) Second Pro Tip: use a bit of pesto instead of the basil leaves. It's amazing!"

I am a fairly advanced home cook.\n The first time I made it exactly as Chef John. Visually it looked the same but it tasted like mashed zucchini in spaghetti with a little cheese. Where was that sweetness? Also, the ratio of zucchini to pasta seemed way off. Way to much zucchini.\n The second time I sliced them thinner 1/16\" , fried them longer and only used 4 average sizes zucchini. I fried them until they were almost like a chip. That is the secret, it's like you caramelize them to bring out the sweetness. This time I also used a garlic infused olive oil and a lot more salt. It was much better and had an earthy flavor. Was it life changing? Not yet, but I am still working on it. It makes me wonder what the Italians have in their olive oil at that restaurant? Hmmmm....wish I could go taste it for myself!"

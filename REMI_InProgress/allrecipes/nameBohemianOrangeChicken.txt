I find rare that I cook recipes that I really really want to make again, but this is definitely one of them. Caraway isn’t a common ingredient I work with, but it really adds a great flavor paired with the sweet and sour orange sauce. This is a definite keeper."

I watched the video again and notice CJ's chicken thighs had its skin only on the top while mine had it wrapped around the entire thigh."

"reviewBody": "Another great one from chef John! The only downside is that there wasn't enough of that sticky sauce to go around. If you've got the time I'd recommend simmering down a small pot of more chicken stock, and more orange+lemon juice (and maybe a pinch of sugar to taste) while the original is in the oven. I would have loved a whole other pot of that wonderful sauce!"

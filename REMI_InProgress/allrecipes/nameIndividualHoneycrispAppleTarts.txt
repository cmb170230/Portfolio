Next time, I'll probably use Granny Smith apples and reduce the erythritol a bit.\n\n(Peeler hint: If your peeler is anything like mine, one side of the blade is sharper than the other. Try reversing your peel and see if you get longer ribbons.)"

"reviewBody": "The hardest thing about this is the technique of getting nice long strips of apple with the potato peeler. I couldn‚Äôt manage it, most of mine were an inch long if that. Luckily it didn‚Äôt matter. I ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù my apple rose inside the ramekin rather than rolling it up outside then dropping it in. My puff pastry ended up a bit overbrown, bordering on burnt (still tasty), so next time I will bake for 25 minutes then check on it."

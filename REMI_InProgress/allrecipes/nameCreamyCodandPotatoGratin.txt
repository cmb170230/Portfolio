I grew up on cod and this is now my lifetime favorite cod dish. \nCan make hours ahead stopping at the point where the dish goes into the oven. Put in fridge covered. When ready, sit on counter for fifteen minutes then pop into the preheated oven until the cod is finished and the top is slightly browned."

"reviewBody": "I’m pretty particular about how I like my fish but this was soooo good! I didn’t have cod so used haddock fillets. We like our fish with a bit of colour so I dusted the fillets with flour and browned them in the butter very briefly before continuing on with the rest of the recipe as written except I used grated Gouda instead of parmesan. I think next time I will make sure to put more of the sauce on the potatoes because they were a little dry in the middle, but other than that it was perfect. I used one 12.5 oz russet potato and it was more than enough for the two of us. I couldn’t even finish my portion. Very rich, filling and satisfying . Will definitely make this again!"

Did some of the steps ahead in the day so dinner would be faster. Comes out of the oven bubbling and brown like the picture. Great for guests, but simple enough for any night of the week."

We probably tried most of them and recommend them to friends and family as a fool proof delicious meals!\nAs soon as Creamy Cod and potato Gratin showed up we made it our Friday Fish meal special and it was fantastic! I had to restrain myself from eating second helping, my husband didn’t and my son who is the pickiest child in the country said it’s his favourite dish after chicken wings (also from Chef John). \nMy only suggestion is do not restrain yourself from that second helping because next day leftovers won’t be as good!)"

"reviewBody": "I made this over the weekend and it was fantastic. A couple of notes. First, I did not listen to Chef John who said to only cook the fish in the sauce for just 1 minute a side. As a result some of my smaller pieces started to flake. It was OK though as I put them in the dishes and all turned out good. But it's just a reminder that there is a reason for the instructions. \nSecond note, and this is a big one. Apparently fresh Cod is extremely expensive. This recipe is scaled for 2. We had to serve six and ended up buying 3 pounds of Cod at $15 a pound. So $45 later... Maybe Chef John can suggest an alternative fish that is less expensive. But in the end, it was great"

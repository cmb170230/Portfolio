"reviewBody": "Super Fantastic! Did not change much at all.... I used Julio's mild salsa with the added chipotle, twice the cumin and some oregano. I made extra salsa so I could season the jalapenos and onions as well as the fish for more of a juice on the chips after baking. I also used Julio's chips, served Spanish rice and refried beans on the side. The green onions, avocado and cilantro on top are a must, but the sour cream mixed with lime juice instead of water...dang!"

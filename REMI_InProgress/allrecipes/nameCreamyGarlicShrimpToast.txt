My husband said “You can make this again!” Only thing I would do differently as per chef’s advice, is remove shrimp from pan before making sauce and add them back in when it’s almost thick enough to finish cooking. Otherwise, they do get overcooked. I served it over angel hair with the crispy toast…so good!!"

Dont skip the SMOKED paprika, it really made an interesting flavor. My husband hates lemon, so I just hid a bit in the recipe then served lemon wedges on the side for me and my son. Everyone came back around looking for 2nds, but I didnt have any ! I'll probably do addition toasted bread next time to sop up the sauce - it's heavy shrimp loaded . It was super easy"

Perfect recipe for two! Oh, and I did use a store bought sourdough bread. Gave a little extra tang to the shrimp sauce."

"reviewBody": "Wowza…This was “lick the plate clean” good!! I didn’t even have fresh garlic OR the right kind of bread and it still turned out delicious. Creamy, lemony, unctuous goodness for the tastebuddies! I had to use garlic powder and some mini French rolls I had on hand (cut in half and crust cut off top and bottom to toast well), so I can only imagine how much BETTER this would be with all of the right ingredients! Recipe SAVED and on ROTATION :) PS: I did add a little ‘Nature’s Seasons’ blend to it for a little flavor boost and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese"

"reviewBody": "I decided to make Shrimp Toast two ways for my husband who does not like shrimp to convince him that he is wrong. This was absolutely delicious. The sauce is a real game changer and would make a shoe tasty. I chose to not cut the crust off my bread (Chef John's No Knead Beer Bread) and obviously I was wrong. Definitely cut some of the crust off. It came together quickly and ate much lighter than you would think. The only complaint from the husband was there was too much shrimp and I was able to assist by adding them to my plate. Will definitely be making again!"

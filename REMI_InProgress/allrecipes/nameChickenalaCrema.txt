"reviewBody": "This recipe takes some effort but the finished product is amazing. The chicken ends up being so tender and packed with flavor from the broth. It had a very mild spice from the poblanos which was perfect for me (I don't love really spicy foods) but the spice could easily be kicked up by adding jalapeños or similar, if you want.\n\nI used all bone-in and skin-on chicken thighs. I found this was much easier and cheaper than buying a whole chicken. I did question the purpose of browning the chicken in the first step since was later discard the skin. Maybe it still imparts some nice flavor though. I do trust Chef John so I'll keep doing it, I just thought it was a little funny.\n\nI did serve this in a bowl with a recipe called \"Mexican Rice and Beans\" by Afzal Najam (here on AllRecipes) and it was an *amazing* combination that I'll be making again and again."

My 10 yr old twin boys have both claimed it is now their favorite food because it was the best sauce and best chicken they ever had. I served it with Spanish rice and soft flour tortillas. It was the first time I ever quartered a whole chicken, I’m glad I learned a new skill as well as a delicious recipe! Thanks Chef John!"

I braised the pork shoulder in the cooking liquid for 3 hours, then added the cream and poblano peppers during the final 20-30 min of the cook (so that the peppers wouldn't be boiled into oblivion). I can't really speak to the chicken version of this recipe, but it worked really, really well with the pork shoulder; some of the best pork I've ever had! Flavors are spectacular, and it went really well with the Spanish rice I made. I imagine it would be great on pasta or mashed potatoes, too."

Heavenly!\nWill DEFINITELY be making this again for my family and it is \"special\" enough for serving guests as well. We LOVED it!!!\nThank You So Much, Chef John, your recipes have NEVER let me or my family down!!"

"reviewBody": "Well these are just exceptionally delicious. I made them for pie day because I didn't want to deal with making crust and wow! They were gobbled up so quickly and the husband was convinced it was perfectly fine as a breakfast food. Who am I to argue with sound logic? I used leftover mini croissants and doubled the recipe. I probably could have filled them up a little more. These are truly foolproof and I will be making these for parties and whenever croissants are on sale! Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Hard to mess up and makes for a delicious treat! I decided to follow a naming trend: A croissant donut is a cronut, croissant muffin is a cruffin, and a croissant waffle is a craffle, so this is a pecan CRIE. Lol I have never baked anything from scratch in my life and it's incredibly easy. Please make sure to own a bread knife or slicing your croissant won't be so easy. Even then, however, once you manage it, it works quite easily. I didn't go for the high-quality stuff and just went with mini croissants from Ralphs. One mini croissant split down the middle is enough for one of these mini pies. Leaves a good bit of overhang though, but the ends are easily snipped and good for mopping up that sweet sauce right before cleanup! If you're looking for a tasty dessert to make for a group, this is an incredibly easy recipe. You HAVE to try it!"

"reviewBody": "I gave this recipe a test-drive, my husband ate one, and in a laconic Texas drawl, said \"Well....yah don't need ta make p'can pies anymore.\" (That means \"WHOO-DANG! I LOVE this!\") We took them to a party and folks VACUUMED them up. Some were near to burned, and one of our friends asked if he could have the extra-toasty ones, which he especially liked. I have NEVER had leftovers. One advantage to having these at a party is that you can pick it up to eat it, leaving your other hand free. Very convenient. This is now a winter party staple for us."

"reviewBody": "Okay so, this is pretty fool proof and the results are phenomenal. Where I didn't follow directions: Used mini croissants from Walmart (lol), didn't have enough corn syrup and used 1/3 cup honey instead to fill out the cup, and my filling never got thick like it did in the video who knows why. AND EVEN THEN, these pies were amazing and a huge hit. Came out of the oven looking like they belonged in a display case at a bakery. The only annoying/time-consuming part about this was trying to grease the tins with cold butter, which was completely on me and not the recipe. P.S. Didn't include the bourbon, so if you're like me and don't want to bother with an extra trip to the liquor store for something you'll never use again, I'd just leave it out."

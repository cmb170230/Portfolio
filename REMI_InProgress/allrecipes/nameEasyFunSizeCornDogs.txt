About 13 minute total at 375-400F."

"reviewBody": "WOW! I don't know what others did, but these were amazing!!! Totally crisp on the outside without frying! Everyone here LOVED them including me who doesn't care for corn dogs in the first place. I got about 28 from my batches and used about 5 hot dogs. The title says \"fun sized\", so I assumed it was my mini muffin pan. And the liquid to dry ratio is the same as my corn muffin recipe so we didn't have any issues with consistency. Than you Chef John for another excellent recipe!"

"reviewBody": "So I followed the recipe, and I'm not sure how 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of cornmeal, and 1 cup of milk is supposed to result in a very thin batter (even with the additional ingredients). The proportions just don't make sense. Mine was almost unstirrable, and I had to add a bunch more milk to get it relatively close to usable. I can see stirring everything but the flour and corn into the liquids and then slowly adding a cornmeal/flour mixture until you get what you want, but you'd never add it all (maybe half?)\n\nAll that said, they were tasty! Also, don't think using paper muffin cups will save you from oiling a pan. Ditch the cups and oil the pan; otherwise you're in for a world of frustration."

"reviewBody": "Neither the recipe nor the video show the size of the mini muffin tins by oz. My mini muffin tin for example, took two sorbet sized scoops of batter, so I only ended up coming out with 11 muffins. Chef John’s tins must have half the capacity than mine did. Also the batter turned out even thicker than in the video so I needed a couple of ounces more milk. With larger muffins, the baking time needed to be increased. The muffins came out tough and tasteless. Needs much more sugar or honey or something. The cornmeal could do with soaking first."

"reviewBody": "I've been craving corn dogs on and off for 30 years or so. These definitely hit the spot! Though I think chef John used cupcake trays, not muffin trays, because I needed to double the recipe to get 20.. Chef John had it right though, because my batter to dog ratio wasn't correct.\n\nIf I were to do this again, I'd find smaller trays so the batter to dog ratio is closer to a traditional corn dog.. and I think I'll add a bit of yogurt for moisture and tang.\n\nEither way, a couple of these with some mustard is incredible"

I agree with some others that adding a touch more sugar would be good. I used medium ground cornmeal and the texture was perfect! Another winner Chef John. Thanks! (I did have a little trouble with them sticking to the mini muffin pan despite careful oiling)."

They cooked up perfectly and I was pleased that the batter rose fo actually completely cover the end of the hot dog. I used shortening to grease the nonstick mini-muffin tin and the all came out perfectly"

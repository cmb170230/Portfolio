Pescetarian friend asked if the mushrooms are what beef tastes like. Lol. No. But they were \"meaty.\" Making this stew again today, but going to throw in slow cooker for after work. Also, I'm adding beef ðŸ˜„"

"reviewBody": "I made this recipe twice and gave it a couple little tweeks the second time. Since I'm not a fan of beef bouillon (I think it tastes \"processed\") I substituted half marinara sauce and half water for the cooking liquid. I also increased the amount of baby bella mushrooms for added \"beefiness.\" I finished the stew with a generous handful of frozen peas right at the end and served with couscous. This recipe is a winner!! Thanks Chef John."

"reviewBody": "Very, very good. The flavour of the gravy is so rich that youâ€™d never know there wasnâ€™t beef. I added an extra 1/2 lb of mushrooms and added about 1.5 cups of frozen peas at the very end of cooking but other than that made no changes. Cooked some dumplings on top. Thanks for a very good meatless meal."

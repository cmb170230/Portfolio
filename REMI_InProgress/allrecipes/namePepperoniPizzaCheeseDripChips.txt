Also, there was a lot of grease, assuming from the pepperoni and they needed to be drained. Mine never were “crispy” like a chip. Any suggestions?"

"reviewBody": "First .... changing ANY of Chef John's recipe is against the law in most states ....... guilty as charged. But, in my defense I only made changes AFTER making it per the recipe first!! The change I made was really beneficial. If you look at the pan in the photo for this recipe it is what I used instead of the parchment &amp; oven. I used my microwave and the non-stick metal microwave pan and the steel elevation rack on high for 5.5 minutes on high. They were PERFECT!!!"

I usually don't review recipes I have adapted, but I had boneless \"chops\" brined in your molasses brine to grill and it started raining, complete with hail warnings. Even with jarred banana peppers and red onion subbing for poblano, it was great. I can't wait to try it dry \"brined\" with poblano as written. Thanks for saving me from hail-related head injury!"

"reviewBody": "This was delicious! The combo of the peppercorn crust with the tangy relish really makes it. I got the \"melange\" packet that contained all of the 4 different kinds of peppercorns. I crushed the whole packet but didn't use it all. I think I'll use try a steak au poivre with the remainder. I used the little bit of leftover warm pickled pepper relish on my eggs this morning. OMG! ?? Amazing! I may need to make a batch of this stuff for the week!"

Meat was not dry and although my thermometer didn't reach 140, I could tell it was done by the feel. Served with the truffle cauliflower by Chef John. Very nice meal."

"reviewBody": "Tasty! Not as great as the peach stuffed pork chops but still a nice variation for pork chops and something for pepper lovers. I used a pepper blend I had already made for seasoning (black, green, white peppercorns, cubeb and all spice). Worked perfectly. I will try different varieties of peppers in the future and see how it affects taste. Instead of poblano peppers (they are not available were I live) I used some mild chilis. I added a teaspoon of corn starch to the sauce because I wanted it thicker but not cook it longer to avoid getting mushy peppers."

We served with cheesy mashed potatoes with a little roasted red pepper whipped phhily mixed in. I will make these again and I will use his pork chop cooking instructions again for other recipes."

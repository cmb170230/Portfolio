The first time that I made it we only had linguini in the house so that is the pasta that I used. My daughter (4 at the time) deemed it Messy Noodles and now I can't use any other pasta when I make it. I do use about half a cup of white wine in the sauce but otherwise the recipe is the same. Make sure that you have real Hungarian Paprika, it makes all the difference"

However, I think this made a tasty and warming meal, perfect for colder days. I notice that it has cayenne pepper in the ingredient list, but (as far as I can tell) doesn't have it stated where to add it in the written directions. I ended up tossing it in at the end, though I suspect, in retrospect, I know where it should have gone in."

Tried to find spaetzle but they didn't have it at the store, so served with rotini which soaks of the heavenly sauce beautifully. Thanks again to Chef John, you always make me look like a pro in the kitchen!"

It fell off the bone and had a ton of flavor, and the sauce was also incredible. Overall, a very satisfying and interesting dish. This recipe has to be given the highest possible marks.” My thoughts and notes: Made this with the cast iron. I only had 6 chicken thighs but did not otherwise scale the recipe, so there was plenty of sauce for the accompanying pasta that I made with the dish. The sauce had a medium spice with the Hungarian paprika and was nice and creamy, kind of like a curry. I did not skim any fat off of the top of the dish, which is obviously unhealthy, but I’m cool with that. Finally, I didn’t have chives on hand but would include them next time as a nice garnish. Otherwise, I don’t think I would change anything."

Everyone loved it!\nI had never had a paprikash before, so I didn't have anything to compare it to, but since it was Chef John's, I can be certain it was one of the best examples!\n\nI am currently on the keto diet, so I had to have it without the pasta/dumplings. I tried to do cauliflower rice, but I don't think it was the right match LOL...ended up just eating the chicken and sauce by itself. \nI regret having it this way. After trying the sauce, I realized this one would have totally been worth cheating on my diet for lol! I can't wait to do it right next time :D.\nThanks, Chef John!"

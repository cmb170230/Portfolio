If you make them bigger obviously they won't be baked through properly. Also, I put 3/4 tsp salt, which is 1/2 of what is used in the recipe"

"reviewBody": "Ok. First time making. Exactly what I was looking for. I did put 1/4 teaspoon vs 1/2 tablespoon. It came out hard crunchy shell with dry bread like cookie. I think that is how suppose to be but the wet ingredients tasted devine. I think I can place 1 cup less flour to make these cookies soft chewy cookies instead. I will test later in the week but I had tasted prior and after flour. It’s still very flavorful. I am thinking adding molasses, star ansis and coriander seeds to even elevate this cookie to the next level but it’s great as is. I suggest adding Lemon zest on top of icing and multi-layers the icing. Add red sugar sprinkles."

"reviewBody": "Made the recipe exactly as written. I didn't have an issue with the amount of salt. The cookies didn't taste salty to me at all. I was however surprised with how dry the dough was. After baking they held together but I wasn't sure if they were baked through. Other than some crispness on the outside, the inside was very chewy and seemed raw, although since the dough was dry to begin with, it was hard to tell. This is my first time making this cookie, so this might be how it is supposed to turn out. The spice flavor is wonderful, but I just didn't love working with this dough or the resulting cookie texture."

I'll be making them but I can't imagine that the amount of salt as currently written in the recipe. I do quite a LOT of baking and 1/2 tbsp Kosher Salt seems like way too much. I'll bake them with 1/2 tsp and report back."

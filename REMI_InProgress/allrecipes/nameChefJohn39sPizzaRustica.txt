"reviewBody": "I made this recipe and was very pleased with how it turned out. I followed most of the recipe exactly except using ham. I used leftover pork chop meat instead. The dough was just enough. I didn’t have to double the recipe as suggested, but there wasn’t any to spare. \nI used dry salami and grated it to get the small bits.as salimi is pretty firm if refrigerated. \nMy family was very pleased with it. \nI was very impressed with the flaky ness of the dough. The trick is getting the dough as cold as possible. I froze the 12 pieces of butter and then combined it with 2/3 cup of the flour and processed in small food chopper to get the butter to break up smaller and then combined it with remaining flour. \nVery pleased with results although it does take quite a bit of time to do. \nThx for the recipe"

"reviewBody": "Recipe turned out exactly as described and was fairly easy, if time consuming. However, with all the meat, it was borderline too salty to eat. I added spinach and put a bit less meat than specified. I would make this again with far less meat and a lot of veggies... spinach was a nice addition. I might add roasted red peppers, broccoli, green onions, etc. The recipe calls for very little added salt, so all the salt is coming from your add-ins. The crust was perfect and held together nicely... work great for a 9-inch non-stick springform pan."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was awesome. My mother has made an \"Easter Pie\" for years that is very similar to this. With the COVID virus going on this year we didn't get to do that. So when chef John posted this a few days before Easter I knew I had to try it. I had never made my own pie dough before, and while I think I kinda messed up the crust a little, the rest of this recipe was fantastic. Mine didn't fully set in the middle and probably needed some more time. Even with all of these mistakes, it was fantastic. I will be making this again for sure."

Clearly Chef John has mad skills and can make anything look easy, but this was my first time making a pie crust. Now, I will say that even though it looked a mess, it tasted incredible! I will make a variation of this recipe again once I get much better at making pie dough, but perhaps I might try it with less meat and put in some pizza vegetables."

The only thing I'd say about this is that the pepperoni and salami are the dominant flavors and if you use other milder meets, they'll just be filler, because you won't taste them. Overall very good."

Making this recipe will cause you to acquire a diabolical urge to keep your refrigerator filled with several pints of heavy whip cream and fresh lemons at all times!! It's so ding-dong-dang yummy!!!! I'm afraid to make Chef John's other cheese recipes! ;)"

Chef John has the best recipes and I never have any problems with making whatever he posts. He mentions a soft creamy version of mascarpone. I would love for him to either post another recipe or even post in the comments about how to create this type of mascarpone. Regardless, I love the cheese and many other recipes. Thank you Chef John."

No salt or any other enhancements were needed, but I might try a lightly sweetened &amp; vanilla-ed version the next time I make it."

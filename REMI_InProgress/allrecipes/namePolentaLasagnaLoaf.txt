"reviewBody": "Tasted great. I only fit three levels of polenta vs four probably because my polenta slices might have been slightly thicker, and I added cooked sausage and caramelized mushrooms to each layer. Let it cool then took chef's advice and flipped for presentation. Fortunately, no disaster and it looked impressive. Late photo attached, we already dug in and ate most of it. When you tent it before going in the oven stick a few toothpicks in first. This makes it easy to keep the tinfoil from touching/sticking to the top."

"reviewBody": "WOW!!! Chef John does it again. To save time I use polenta roll instead of cooking from scratch and saved some money buying parmesan rinds (1/2 the price) for the required cheese. I used a food processor to blend the polenta and parm rinds with some water for creaminess. WHAT A MISTAKE! It took so much longer as my food processor was too small and the rinds were very hard to process. Anyway, I got it done and spread the layers without refrigeration which worked out fine. I made enough for 2 loaf pans. I forgot to put on the foil however, it turned out beautifully golden brown. But no one will see that as I flipped it:) Taste...oh man oh man! So good!! This is certainly a hit - especially since I made some variations to the original. Too bad I am the only one eating this...or maybe not. Highly recommend Chef John's Polenta Lasagna Loaf."

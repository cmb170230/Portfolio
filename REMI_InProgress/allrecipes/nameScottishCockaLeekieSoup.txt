I thought I would miss the carrots and celery and all the other usual ingredients but you don’t. The broth is outstanding. Try not to skip the part where you simmer the bones and skin, that’s where all the flavor lives!"

"reviewBody": "I'm not very experienced with soups (or leeks!), but this one grabbed my attention with the simplicity and, honestly, the idea of the prunes. Wish I had a picture! Mine turned out a bit darker and cloudier than Chef John's final product (I think because I didn't bother skimming?), but the taste was absolutely great, and there was a ton of leftover chicken to be used. Also, there's just something magical about using something as green and hearty as the leek tops when starting out. Awesome!"

"reviewBody": "Followed the recipe and it was just okay at best. I had to use chicken bouillon to give the broth some flavor at the end and it still was lacking. Maybe its because I used larger leeks ( still the required measurements cut smaller) or the leaner fat hen? I even added extra prunes because they were small.....don't know about this one."

I used 2 lb. of chicken legs rather than a whole chicken and agree with the video recommendation to use less meat in the soup. It was a hearty stand-alone soup for a dinner meal."

"reviewBody": "This is one of the most flavorful soups I've had. Having not made many soups in my life, whenever I've had a chicken noodle or something similar, I find myself hunting for the pieces of chicken, noodles, carrots, anything to eat with the broth. This soup was almost opposite. I enjoyed the rich broth more than the protein and the flavor stayed with me for a long time after the last spoonful. Highly recommend this soup! I did end up adding the Thyme and rice options. Which I think both worked really well."

It was so rewarding to make this delicious soup, not just heat something up from a processed form that comes in a can. Thank you for the directions and the video. 'Til next time."

It’s also perfect soup for “I feel sick” season as it seemed to clear my sinuses while simultaneously soothing my very broken tummy. Next time, I want to try it with barley and see which version I like better."

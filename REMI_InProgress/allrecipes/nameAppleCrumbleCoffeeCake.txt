"reviewBody": "Finished cake was superb. My changes as I appreciate less sugar: ~1/2cup of brown sugar only for crumble. Plus I used chopped pecans as I didn't have walnuts ( hint - don't short the quantity of nuts in the crumble - mine crumble covered thinly, but it worked. For wet ingredients I cut sugar to 1/2 cup and I used greek yogurt. i also used 2 -apples (because that's what i had left from my tree). However - the the batter was too thick (maybe from the thicker greek yogurt?) compared to the batter shown on the video. So I added ~ 1/4 cup of sour cream and some milk to get the consistency correct. Everyone at the brunch loved it. Thanks for posting this recipe. I'll use it again on our brunch rotation. Cheers"

The three things I changed, because of not having Honey Crisp Apples, Yogurt and Walnuts, were using 3 peeled and chopped Granny Smith Apples, chopped Pecans, and Sour Cream. Still a winner and a keeper! By the way, the two teaspoons of butter under the dry ingredients are for coating your pan."

I just bought a bag of chopped walnuts to keep on the side. I would suggest if you’re taking the walnuts out to increase the amount of “crumb” you make, I wasn’t able to fully cover the cake, but it still turned out delicious. I will be making this again!"

I have to confess I cheated on the initial step of creaming butter and sugar by hand...my butter had not softened adequately, but enough so that I used a mixer. Once creamed, every step after was by hand as intended. Can't imagine it made any difference! Used quality plain Greek yogurt and substituted the extra-large Fuji apple I had on hand. This will be my go-to apple coffee cake! Yum!"

Who has a 9x12 pan? 9x13 sure, but that made the cake too thin. “2 apples” is not specific enough; I used 3 that cut into tiny pieces was 2 cups. Measurements please! I am going to try making it in a 10” springform pan, and then cut into wedges."

I had the most trouble evenly spreading the thick batter in my 9x13 pan, but the rise durning baking changed my attitude about using a smaller pan in the future. This one is a keeper! Thanks Chef John! (ps, the photo does not do it justice, but it's the best one I had.)"

"reviewBody": "With the amount of sugar crumble topping, I decided to bake it on the middle rack and it came out fine. Like others have mentioned, yes, this recipe has tons of sugar, you can barely taste the cake in my opinion. But that's what recipes are for. Make sure you read it throughly and alter as you go and make notes for next time. I had to scrape off most of the crumble topping but still too sweet for my own preference because of the middle crumble layer. You still rock Chef John Thank! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "The cake itself is a decent recipe. The \"crumble\" is horrible. It's literally just nuts and sugar. To call this a crumble is ridiculous, but against my better judgement I decided to try it. Just as suspected, it started to burn before the cake was done. Then when the cake WAS done the \"crumble\" was just loose sugar in some spots, burnt sugar and nuts in others. \n\nDecided to try again using my personal standard crumble topping with some pecans in it instead of walnuts and it came out much better. Double checked my oven temp, which was spot on, so decided to bake at 325 convection and had much better results. \n\nOverall not the worst recipe, but about what I expect from \"chef\" John."

I cut back the amount of sugar in the batter to reduce overall sweetness. \n\nI had to use a 9x13 inch pan. Since one baker said the batter was thick, I evenly spaced large spoonfuls of batter in the pan. It was easier to distribute than one big pile. The cake cooked to perfection in 30 minutes. And, try some before it's fully cooled. It will put a smile in your belly!"

I also used my 8\"x11.5\" Pyrex Casserole dish and baked the Cake for 55 minutes, again, that's what I have. I will say that the Cake had a better texture the next day for Breakfast with Coffee. That made a lot too, so I shared with the next door neighbors. I tell ya, this recipe is a keeper!"

The cake itself was fluffy, tender, and moist, with a subtle apple flavor, which were soft without being mushy. \n\nI loved the walnuts but found the crumble just a hair too sweet overall, while my brother was fine with the sweetness but hated the walnuts. \n\nThe cake, however, doesn't seem to last long, with the moisture from the apples turning the cake soggy after few hours. It's still delicious, but the best time to eat it is definitely the same day it was baked."

Instead of 1c of yogurt, I used 1/4c condensed milk and 3/4c sour cream. Since I did that, I cut the sugar in the batter by about a tablespoon. I replaced the sea salt with Himalayan pink salt (I think it’s a better salt for baking). I also used granny smith apples and pecans."

"reviewBody": "What a fun Halloween recipe! I thought it looked pretty neat so I made it for the kids before trick or treating. I wasn't sure how it would go over with the kids but it was a smash hit! I served over some leftover Chef John pizza sauce. All of the kids commented on how well-seasoned the filling was and they loved the cheese. This has solidified Aunt Lacy's house as the Halloween pre-part destination spot. Thanks Chef John!"

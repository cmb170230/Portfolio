"reviewBody": "An excellent recipe for leftover Thanksgiving turkey in place of the chicken. Just eyeball the quantity based on video. Make initial pastry less acute, maybe 25 degrees, and alternate weaveâ€¦right, leftâ€¦left, rightâ€¦right, left, etc so that you alternate which side is on top. Carefully watch bake time; mine only took 25 mins. Definitely will make again, and may also try this procedure with pork tenderloinâ€¦sort of a pork Wellington. Lightly brown tenderloin, make a duxelle, use some dijon mustard, etc. A fun process to play around with. ðŸ¥‚"

The second one, I used my leftover bbq turkey. I changed the herbs to rosemary and skipped the lemon. I preferred the original. But the other way was good."

"reviewBody": "Great dish! I didn't have rotisserie chicken, so I poached 3 chicken breasts. I added dried tarragon when I added the cream; tarragon really brings a lot of flavor to this dish. I had purchased Pepperidge Puff Pastry which has smaller dimensions (2 sheets, about 9x10). So we made two smaller strudels. If using Pepperidge pastry, the filling would be enough for 4, maybe 5, strudels. Cooked at 425 for 35 minutes. Probably could have pulled it out sooner, to get a lighter color. Will definitely make again!"

It was even good reheated in the air fryer. I served with a reduced chicken stock sauce and while it added a little flavor and moistness, the strudel didn't need it. This would be a great entree for a group. The husband gobbled it up and asked for seconds. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "very tasty and will make again-but with a change to the bake time and temp. flavor wise, this was A+. the lemon flavor is stronger than we assumed it would be, but it wasnt unwelcome. it took what could have felt like a heavy rich dish from the cream amd mushrooms, and gave it a nice bright balanced flavor. it looks like a dryer filling, but its not dry at all on eating. we wouldnt change anything about the filling. the baking instructions however led us a bit astray. we followed the written here guide to bake at 450 but only did 30 minutes to start, so we could keep an eye on it. and im glad we did, because it was nearly burnt! it was salvageable, but definitely way dark and blackened in some places. we were really confused on what went wrong, since we were on the low end of time and our thermometer said our oven was accurate, and on re watching the video chef john says to bake at 425 instead. i think thats probably the issue, so we will definitely be adjusting that next time. if you ignore that error in the written i think youll be good, just keep an eye on it."

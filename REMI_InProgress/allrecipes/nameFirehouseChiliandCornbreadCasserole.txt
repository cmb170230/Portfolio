"reviewBody": "Oh yeah! This was good. Chef John’s recipes seem to always be good. Since it’s just my husband and me I had to cut the recipe in half. I used bell pepper instead of the poblano peppers and I didn’t have any crushed tomatoes so I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce, otherwise I followed the recipe. I only used about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper but I should have cut that back to 1/8 tsp because the heat was overpowering but still good. I put about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese in the one box of cornbread mix (Jiffy) but couldn’t taste it, probably because of the cayenne. I will make it again, it’s really good."

Highly recommend and frankly, I might not ever make chili any other way. The crunchy corn bread on the top was to DIE for and will likely add more next time. \n\nHere are the changes I made. Ground turkey instead of beef. Chipotle spice instead of cayenne. Oat milk instead of cow. Used 2 cans of of fire roasted diced tomatoes, no crushed. Added some left over black beans to use up as well as Kidney. Double all the spices except salt. \n\nNext time, I will make all these same changes, but also add diced jalapeno to the corn bread mix with the cheese. GREAT recipe!!!"

The only change I made is I cooked and baked this in my large Dutch oven (6 qt). I’m a big fan of one-pot meals. This did lead to the cornbread being a little thicker and took about 5 extra minutes of baking time. Will definitely add this to my favorites!"

"reviewBody": "This was wonderful. The cornbread topping really hits it out of the park. I can't handle too much spice so I just used one tbsp of chilli and 2 tbsp of cumin and added cinnamon stick and bay leaf to my simmering pot. This created a milder heat level but still full of flavour. Delightful! Also, I couldn't find corn muffin mix in the grocery store but it was easy enough to make with cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and vegetable oil. Just google jiffy corn muffin copycat recipe."

Made during the Coronavirus shortage, so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (no crushed tomatoes in the stores); used Marie Callender cornbread mix, Jiffy all gone in stores. Spooned out a cup of chili so that the cornbread mix would fit, and that reserve came in handy to chili-fy my husband’s 2nd serving. Super yummy &amp; easy recipe."

I used the Gluten Free Corn Muffin Mix from Bob's Red Mill since the regular Jiffy mix was out of stock, and used regular sharp cheddar cheese. I just followed the instructions on the package of corn muffin mix and doubled the cheese since gluten free stuff tend to be drier. Crust tuned out moist and perfect. For the chili, I could only get regular diced tomatoes so I used two cans of that. This recipe is very forgiving and hard to mess up. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Chef John!"

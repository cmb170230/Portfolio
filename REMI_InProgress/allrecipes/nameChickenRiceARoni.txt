Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the thighs and legs can be pulled easily from the carcass, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl, carefully tipping the carcass to drain any broth from the cavity back into the stockpot."

I usually just buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco and boil the carcass down to make the stock. And leave out the garbanzos and bell peppers since the kids aren't fans lol. A+++ in our house!"

Sure enough, no cracks, there's a bit of a sheen to it and the taste is down-to-earth yummy, it was comforting. I added Abt a teaspoon of vanilla and a T of melted butter to the filling. Don't skip the salt but maybe add a lot less than called for. I always pre-bake my pie crust. Thanks Chef John!"

The only thing I did differently was to use 3 whole eggs instead of 1 egg + 3 egg yolks, and used a 10\" pie dish. Everything else was the same. It browned a bit sooner than the recipe said, more like 15 minutes st 425°+ 20 minutes at 350° was enough in my oven, so just check on it when it gets closer to the time. A keeper!"

Further, I baked at 325 (due to not wanting a burnt crust) for around 45 minutes, and it turned out EXCEPTIONALLY well! I just did the ole cheese cake tap-check to see how the jiggle jiggle went, and once it jiggled a touch but then sprang back to form, I knew it was ready!! We let it sit overnight and we freaking crushed it on Thanksgiving!"

"reviewBody": "It was really good, my dad who hates pumpkin pie loved it!!! Changes I made: Instead of using canned pumpkin i used fresh pie pumpkins and after getting all strings and seeds out i baked them on a cookie sheet face down for an hour at 375F, one pie pumpkin is plenty, then i just pureed it. I did 2 or 3 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger, a sprinkle of Chinese 5 spice, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of bourbon, I do recommend doing more seasonings, brown sugar and bourbon as I feel it wouldn't have taste without. I used a premade pie crust and knowing they dry out quick, I made a milk wash. I first made buttermilk with 1/4 cup milk and a splash of lemon juice, after whipping it i put some brown sugar in and 2 tablespoons of bourbon. i would recommend doing this with any crust since it gave it a bit of flavor. while baking every 10 minutes i used the milk wash with some melted butter in it so that the crust didn't dry out or burn, because premade crusts bake quite quick."

"reviewBody": "Wow! I love this pie. In the past, I have made the other two highly rated pumpkin pies on this site, but I like this one better. Creamier, without that \"wet\" taste. Instead of whipped cream, I make meringue with the extra egg whites. Why throw them away? I did not use the Chinese spice because I don't use it. The first time I made it, my family thought it was not so flavorful. So, I now use a heaping spoonful of the spices, except for the salt. Which remains the same amount. I also use a ready-made graham pie crust. After the first 15 minutes were up, I put a crust guard on the pie crust. It was done in 30 minutes. The center is a little jiggly and that's what you want. My family loves this pie!"

I didn't like the consistency but my wife did. I think two eggs and 2 yolks might make a more custardy pie (will try soon)."

"reviewBody": "I made this pie for the 1st time to bring as THE Pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner.\nI normally wouldn't bring a pie un-vetted to such an occasion, but I tried on a wing &amp; a prayer hoping the recipe wouldn't \"2020\" out on me.\nEveryone loved it, and so did I . Been searching for the perfect P-pie recipe, and I have found. \nThe one substitution I made: \nI could not be bothered to search out the 5-chinese seasoning blend, and instead subbed out 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper, as this was the kicker and extra special ingredient from another pumpkin pie recipe I tried last year.\nIt worked perfectly, don't be afraid to try! It is subtle, &amp; just gives the pie a weeee extra kick"

Not sure how the two compare. This is likely the best pumpkin pie I've ever made. Great taste, not too sweet, great consistency if you let cool completely. Very easy to make, even for absolute beginners. Result is an upscale pie taste without the upscale pie hassle."

Because of CoVid and my brother being a nurse in a CoVid unit, we did not get to celebrate as we normally would. I was hoping this would come out ok for our small family dinner. It was better than ok, this pie turned out absolutely amazing and the flavor was rich and flavorful. I did use cloves instead of five spice because I didn’t have/couldn’t find it but it was excellent. I think I will be making it again very soon as the one I made is already wiped out! Yum!!"

I used 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and a pinch of white pepper in lieu of individual spices listed (plus the salt)."

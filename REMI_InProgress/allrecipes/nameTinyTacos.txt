"reviewBody": "These were amazing! I’m going to be the person I hate and say that I made a change because I only had flour tortillas. I had to be very careful frying them because they crisped up quickly. I used them in a taco salad just like a local restaurant makes by my house. I made a dressing of 6oz sour cream, 1/4 cup Mayo, about a 1/4 cup of Mexican style tomatoes with jalapeños, 1T lime juice, 2 large chopped garlic pieces, and then I added cumin, cilantro, chili powder, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper to my liking. Blended it all up and it was awesome!"

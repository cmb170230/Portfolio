"reviewBody": "My family lost their minds over this stuffing. My youngest son who has never tried stuffing, couldn't get enough of this. I would say that it was everyone's favorite dish. I was reluctant to try this recipe as there were no reviews of it prior to Thanksgiving. I took a leap of faith and am so glad I did. This is crazy good. The flavor reminds me of my aunt's Pennsylvania Dutch potato filling, only with bread. The only change I made was using organic white bread instead of French bread. Next year I'm going to double the recipe because it's almost gone the next day!"

It would be cool if when you say 1/2 stick of butter, you also add weight since some folks don't live in the USA and butter doesn't come in USA sticks. I pretended I was cooking and interpreted the amount of onion to match the amount of celery instead of guessing what a large onion is. Peace out!"

What I also love about chef John is he explains WHY you do the things you do to make a tasty dish. Eg, using dried bread crumbs and how browning it enhances taste and texture. I am throwing all the other recipes out!!"

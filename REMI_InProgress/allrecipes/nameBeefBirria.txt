But the end result is ahhhhhmazing and after all that work you will be so proud of yourself and your family will worship the ground that you walk on. I made it and yeah, it's all that and more. Definitely READ ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS first and watch the video because I ended up missing an important step in making the consomme. Still tasted dang good though. Chef John is seriously a cooking genius. Love this guy."

"reviewBody": "Another wonderful recipe from Chef John. I have made this now twice and both times have been outstanding in flavor. I apologize about my picture invoking so much onion and cilantro, but those toppings cut amazingly well against this rich flavorful stew. I have never had Beef Birria before at Mexican restaurants here in California before. If I do, I now have a high level of standard of what to expect. Simply bliss. The second time enjoying this recipe I introduce some nice corn tortillas and it was very tasty as a vessel."

I also used lamb and beef short ribs as I had frozen lamb left over from Easter. I used left over beef to make enchiladas as I'm not a fan of tacos. Used the sauce thickened in place of enchilada sauce. WOW this recipe is a keeper.Thank you"

I skipped the consumé but the tacos the next day dipped in a fire roasted green chile sauce were even better. I used a fatty beef roast without the short ribs because I was making for one and the store didn't sell these things in small quantities, but otherwise followed the recipe ... Absolutely amazing recipe. Thank you Chef John!"

Lol when I made the tacos they where so crispy and slightly oily from that glorious red Chile oil. My husband near fell out of his chair...my kids loved it! My in laws are Guatemalan, I made it for them and they went crazy for it! I just seasoned the meat for another round of these things. That’s three times in 6 months. This recipe is a keeper!"

Both times it's come out delcious, but I agree with Chef John that goat takes it to a whole other level.\n\nIf goat's hard to come by, beef is a good substitute. But I really recommend goat. I got mine from a halal market, if you happen to have one in your area."

Also made the birria tacos that chef John has a recipe for. Incredible! Don't miss this one. The most flavorful braised meat I've had, and Incredible tacos."

I followed the recipe exactly, and like Chef John, I reduced it so it's more of a thick stew. I served it over quinoa with some chopped onions, cilantro and lime and a salad on the side. Paired it with a nice Malbec from Argentina. A++++++ stew. I'm definitely making the tacos with the leftovers."

I took the meat out and pulled it apart, then cooked down the sauce a bit more (30mins-1 hour) and put the meat back in the sauce to heat back up. Then served in the sauce to be put directly on tacos. Super jucy meat and so delicious. Great recipe!"

I used a brand new immersion blender, and it pureed the veggies well. Not sure what happened, but the meat was good. I'll go back to my regular beef stew recipe. I even let the meat sit overnight in the fridge with the spices rubbed in...will not attempt again...Usually love Chef Johns recipes!"

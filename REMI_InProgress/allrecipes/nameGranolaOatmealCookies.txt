"reviewBody": "I hate oatmeal due to the texture but love oatmeal breakfast \"cookies\" so I decided to try this. I used Quaker granola with honey and almonds. However, when I got up this morning I realized my baking soda had expired. I substituted self-rising flour (Do Not Do This-lol). I also had an apple in the fridge I needed to use quickly, and I love apples with granola. I cut it into very tiny pieces and added about half the apple. The apple was an amazing addition! The cookies were delicious straight out of the oven--crisp on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside. However, as the day wore on, they grew soft and crumbly. This is completely my fault due to using the self-rising flour. I will be doing this recipe again (with the proper ingredients) and can't wait to share at Christmas!"

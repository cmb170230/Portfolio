"reviewBody": "I loved it, as into each batch of salmon a little tail must happen, and it was terrific! I prefer my salmon in Steak format, simply because I am SO finicky about my salmon being *medium-rare* throughout. I measure height &amp; weight of piece precisely, and calculate exactly how long to bake, turn, re-baste, bake, broil last 45 seconds, then rest under foil. When I take it out, it is not done, but finishes during resting! All this with an old Cuisinart toaster oven! Love that puppy!!! My question is, I’ve wrapped the “flaps” around, but what if I cut them off and join them as a little flat raft using this recipe! I bought recently bought 4 steaks when my market had them, &amp; I individually wrapped for freezer. I cut the tails off all, originally bagging for freezer to use to make my own broth. However, I think I may try this with one set of 4. Hmmmm! I’ll re-post!"

It came out just perfect as I followed him as I made the fun spirals. Loved the sauce on top and the dill just made them! I even made up a cucumber salad to serve it on. Anyway, I didn't change a thing (never do with Chef John's recipes) and can't wait to make them for company. They look so cool on the plate and take no time to cook. Ten minutes was just right! Loved this so much! Just a different little spin on salmon......."

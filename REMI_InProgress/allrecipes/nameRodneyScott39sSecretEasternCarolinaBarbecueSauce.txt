I cut then and then used a garlic press to squeeze them. I don't think you leave the rind in the sauce. Just a little confusing therefore only 4 stars."

"reviewBody": "Very close to what we eat in the Raleigh area. A little more spicy but that can be adjusted. Now that you have done Eastern NC BBQ Sauce recipe I would love to see a Lexington, NC style BBQ Sauce. Stamey's BBQ in Greensboro is the best and so is their slaw. You can't eat NC BBQ without the slaw"

Chocolate, cinnamon sugar, pepperoni and mozzarella, mushroom duxelle, all made wonderful fillings and made me look like a rock star. Thanks,Chef John! I can't believe I'm the first to review this amazing bread."

"reviewBody": "Great recipe, thank you Chef John! I don’t have a stand mixer so I used the dough hook attachments of my handheld mixer to combine the milk, yeast, egg, softened butter, and water roux first before slowly mixing in the dry ingredients until it was clumped enough for me to hand knead it. I hand kneaded the dough for 5 minutes and followed the rest of the instructions (except for the fact that I had to cram the 5th roll in the middle of my cake pan bc my cake pan was not 10 inches) My oven runs a little hotter so my bread was fully cooked and brown on top at 25 minutes. I do think the recipe could use a tad more sugar but maybe that’s just my sweet tooth speaking lol"

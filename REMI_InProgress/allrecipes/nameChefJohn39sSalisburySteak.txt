I also think there are unnecessary steps here, it makes a lot more sense to sear the patties, set them aside, cook the gravy on same pan, re-add the patties to finish. This tasted fine at the end of the day but the recipe has some issues."

I tripled the recipe to make enough to freeze for lunches for my dad— par cooked some, put them in containers with compartments made for this along with a vegetable and starch. Instead of tripling the ketchup, I doubled it and then used 2tbls of steak sauce. And didn’t have dry mustard so I used spicy brown. Worked fine. One thing for next time— I will only double the gravy as tripling it excessive, haha!"

To the Chef's horror I substituted beef bouillon (3 cubes) and a 4 oz. can of mushroom pieces. WHO CARES? It came out great, Fantastic flavor, lots of gravy. I fully recommend following the steps on the patties carefully. They came out soft and flavorful and did not fall apart."

I didn't chill the beef. Just made the patties and baked them in the oven for 20 minutes (350 degrees) while I cooked the onions &amp; mushrooms. Then I made the gravy all in the same pan (didn't remove the onions and mushrooms) then added the cooked beef patties. Less time, less work."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe exactly, including the rest time for the meat, and while the finished product looked beautiful, and the patties were moist and tender, both the meat and the sauce had a strong taste of Worcestershire sauce and ketchup. When I checked the expiration date on the Worcestershire sauce, it was 2 years out of code as I don't use much of it in my cooking. That's the only explanation I have for it because most reviews are positive. That, and the fact that two tablespoons of it is a lot more than I've ever seen in a recipe. If I were to make this again, I'd use two teaspoons instead, and perhaps add some mild chopped green chiles for flavor. I did toss out the rest of the bottle of Worcestershire sauce."

It took a little longer to make than I thought, but it was definitely worth it, and next time I make it I'm sure it will be faster, because there WILL BE a next time! I didn't have bread crumbs so I soaked some white Italian bread in milk ... which is how I make meatballs ... and that worked great. Upscale Salisbury Steak. Glad I found this recipe."

"reviewBody": "My husband and I loved this recipe; We usually don't agree on a 5 star rating. I made the recipe as is except for 3 minor changes. I added 2 chopped garlic cloves when the onions were almost translucent. I used 90% lean ground beef because I had it. Also, the broth seemed too liquidy even after the suggested 10 minutes of boiling. So, I mixed another Tablespoon of flour with about 1/4 cup cream. I whisked this into the broth and it was perfect. We liked the amount of mustard and all other flavors in the recipe. I did let the meat mixture sit in the frig for about 2 hours as suggested, and I was surprised how moist the steaks came out, even with leaner beef. Thanks for this recipe, Chef John."

The skin on the chicken was soggy and greasy and tasted great. Along with the mashed potatoes, string beans that squeaked on your teeth and a pastry that was soggy also, but good. I made your Salisbury Steak and it came out great. Since I am a spicy freak, I added a little heat, I watch you on youtube all the time."

I had to skim out the mushrooms from the gravy (she hates 'em). But she loved it! And kept telling me how good it was! So I could make more, I did add a pound of ground turkey and increased the amount of the steak ingredients 1.5 times. I kept everything else the same and it turned out awesome."

The meat texture is moist without being mushy and the gravy is to die for.

I use Bragg's soy sauce substitute, high quality worstershire, organic ketchup with very low sugar, my own organic ground beef and my own organic bread crumbs. I also use organic brown mushrooms and organic flour (and make sure they are well browned), a few drops of liquid smoke and chipotle seasoning along with regular cayenne. I believe quality ingredients make for a quality dish. It's difficult to keep myself from eating more than one of these at a sitting, delicious!!\nI have made these several times when we feel like having a hamburger and my wife and I love them!!!

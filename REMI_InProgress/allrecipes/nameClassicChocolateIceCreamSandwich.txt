"reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! I made the recipe as written, but converted the measurements to weights to be more exact. So that I could use the correct ice cream scoop for the cookies, I took a screenshot of the ice cream scoop used in the video and enlarged the photo. The number on the scoop is 40 which equates to 1 1/2 tablespoons (see attached). I used my 1 1/2 tablespoon ice cream scoop but was only able to get 10 cookies from the recipe. Perhaps I over-filled the ice cream scoop. Like another reviewer, I used both a silicone mat and parchment paper and really couldn't tell any difference between the two. Anyway, the ice cream sandwiches were delicious!"

"reviewBody": "Super easy and just as described - Classic Ice Cream Sandwich! I wasn't sure about scoop size so I ended up using a #30 scoop with a double batch of cookie dough. Made 17 1/2 \"cookies\" about 3\" in diameter (baked 9 minutes). Filled with Kirkland Brand (from CostCo) Vanilla ice cream and then took 1/2 the batch and rolled the ice cream ends in star sprinkles - super fun and tasty! My husband missed the rectangle shape so next time I am going to try making in a 9 x 13 pan and cutting them. Thanks Chef John!"

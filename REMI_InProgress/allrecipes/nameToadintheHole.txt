I felt the onion gravy needed a little extra flavor, so I added 1/2 tsp. Perfect Pinch Garlic and Herb Seasoning. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "First time I’ve made this. I asked my husband, who’s English, what he thought. He liked it! He suggested including a Tbs of self rising flour in the batter. I didn’t use cayenne because he gave me a look, and he was a little perplexed about salad with it. So we did peas. But overall, he said it was very good and he grew up eating this dish! So we will make this again."

It didn’t puff as much as I hoped due to my mistakes, but flavor is great. The only thing I’d change is double or even triple the amount of onion gravy. We just couldn’t get enough of that deliciousness! Once again Chef John nailed it!"

"reviewBody": "So good. Made this tonight but because I shop at Aldi, my banger options were limited between breakfast sausage and bratwurst Hahaha! Besides this little switch this dish was surprisingly simple when prepping. I love the gravy— probably could’ve cooked the onions a tiny bit more but I like more crunch, anyway. And wow, I’ve only ever had popovers before— not yorkshire pudding, but I love the simple yummy flavor and texture of the pudding. Also I should add that my bratwurst went amazingly well with this. \nThey also popped and spat at me like in John’s YT demo of this. But all of this turned out so yummy! I was also expecting it’d feel heavier but it wasn't at all (sometimes heavy stuff makes me icky) an overall a wonderful dish! \nSo far every recipe Ive followed from Chef John has been a hit"

He has attempted to make it his self and it is never\"just right\". He didn't care for the gravy , (onions were to big and gravy was to thick but those were my mistakes. I will definitely be making this again!!"

"reviewBody": "We needed to use up some extra pie dough (Chef John's peach pie...also yum) and it was good! the crust did pop open a bit but not too bad, probably didn't have enough to really wrap it well. we used a honey crisp apple, next time would use same or granny smith. It turned out crisp brown, gooey and delicious! Wouldn't change a thing."

I've made this at least five times now, and it's great. I don't really like the peels left on, so I peel the apples now. These are like mini apple pies, but better. Ignore the people complaining about splitting and just make it."

"reviewBody": "I used the commercial puff pastry I had on hand instead of pie pastry. The dumplings turned out nice and tasted okay. I used 4 different types of apples, Envy, golden delicious, fuji, and honey bee. After 60 minutes of baking, the former two types likely resulted in better texture. The Fuji was a bit too firm for my liking. The overall flavour could use something to give it more interest. Maybe next time I’ll add a few Crasins in the apple. The dumplings were not as sweet as I thought they would be even though the syrup itself was sweet. I made 10 apple dumplings, but in hindsight I really didn’t need to double the syrup, because now I have nearly a cup of it left over. This recipe is a good starting point."

The crust has a great hard glaze to it. #ForkDon'tLie They're cooling currently &amp; once I get a feel for the doneness of the Fuji apple, I'll know if 50 minutes was the right time or not."

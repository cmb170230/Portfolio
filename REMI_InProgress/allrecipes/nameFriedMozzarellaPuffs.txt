"reviewBody": "I made this four ways, two recipe variations with two cooking variations. First was exactly as the recipe says with half fried in oil and the other half in the air fryer. The second recipe substituted the mozzarella for gruyere and a little Parmigiano with half cooked in oil and half in the air fryer. If you are looking at the picture the top left is the as given by Chef John, which were gobbled pretty quickly which is why there is only one left. From there going counter clockwise we have original air fried, gruyere fried, then air fried. One thing i did differently was to use a scoop instead of the two spoon method, i might go with a bigger scoop next time, although, these were great bite size appetizers. I enjoyed them all."

"reviewBody": "I wondered whether I should give this a 5 star because I only ate two! The family ate the rest of them (asking for seconds) so since they loved them...5 stars it is. My comments are that he is 100% right when he says that when you add the egg it will look like something went tragically wrong. Even though I was aware of that fact I had my doubts. I ended up using a combination of spatula to mash and smash and whisk to...whisk. Eventually the dough came together. Lastly, I dispensed with the two spoon football method and used my hands to form the dough and dropped them in with a slotted spoon. I made different sizes and the really small ones (3 peas size) were not liked as much. So, I made inch to inch and a half tubes and they were the best received. One note for everyone. Get your oil up to temp of the puffs will sink to the bottom and stick there. I had this problem at first but once the oil was to temp it solved itself. It is on the unanimous remake list."

I made these as-is, with the exception of the cayenne (no one likes it). So much easier than homemade mozzarella sticks, and I'd venture to say these are tastier!"

I would definitely make them again but I would add basil or Italian seasoning to make them more flavorful. I didn't make the sauce. I just served them with spaghetti sauce. I will try the jazzed up version next time. Chef John always has great recipes!"

The taste and texture are unique yet comforting! Like, if mac 'n' cheese and a mozzarella stick had a baby! Delicious. Next time I'll double the batch; there are just 2 of us but we ate them in record time. I've been a longtime fan of Chef John, and the video helped me know I wasn't doing it wrong when it felt like I was."

I might try this recipe with other cheeses some day just to see how it comes out.\nOnly thing I changed was that I doubled the ingredients. The amount of dough that came from the list here made enough for about 4 balls, not 8, but I may have just been making them too big. Either way, they taste amazing."

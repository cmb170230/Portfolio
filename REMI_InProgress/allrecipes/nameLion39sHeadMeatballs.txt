I drizzled chili sesame oil over the top with green onions. I bought ingredients that I don’t use often so very relieved they won’t go to waste because this recipe is a keeper! It was also fun to make. The tofu really makes these meatballs light and airy. Thanks Chef John!"

Some variations on the recipe that this writer and others on the internet stated were: I used dry sherry (on hand), fresh shitake mushrooms (pan seared first), baked at 475 instead of broiled for 15 min. This was a great leftover as well. I finely chopped everything and you will be glad if you do too."

I’ve never put brown sugar in with the meatballs so I was a little apprehensive but the rest of the ingredients were familiar. They came out tasting great and the steps seemed more streamlined than other recipes I’ve tried. This will be my new go to!"

Delicious.\nThis is a light meatball with lighter texture and some crunch. Don’t expect an Italian style meatball when making this. It’s an Asian style meatball."

And it was a lot of work with some exotic ingredients that will unlikely be used again before having to be thrown away. Dish was tasty enough (tho a bit salty..more brown sugar?) but won't make again for those reasons."

"reviewBody": "I will definitely make this again. I didn't change anything. Wonderful flavors that go so well together. I wasn't too happy with the Nappa Cabbage though. I never had it before. It has a light subtle flavor compared to regular green cabbage but it wasn't as tender as I would have liked and it's rather expensive. Strangely to me the stalky parts were tender and the leaves were tough. Cooking the leftovers longer didn't help. It was a large head after doing some reading I might not have peeled enough of the outer leaves away. My first time trying Shiitake mushrooms too. They too have a nice subtle flavor but again rather expensive compared to reasonable substitutes. Next time I'll try Green Cabbage and Baby Portabellas. The meatballs are so flavorful I think they can stand up to stronger flavors. I added some Angel Hair Rice Noodles to the leftovers. Good stuff."

The meatballs in this, on the other hand, are extremely light. I actually went back for seconds. Cooking was easy as well. I reduced the liquids down for 25 minutes rather than 10 as I like it slightly thicker, and the meatballs weren’t anywhere near being overcooked. \n\nHighly recommended."

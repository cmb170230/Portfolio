"reviewBody": "Wonderful recipe. If you're getting \"dough soup\", try using 300g - 310g flour in the second part. You're \"fluffing\" your flour to measure it and not adding enough. Follow Chef John's direction and go by stretchy-ness to know when you've added enough. At least if there's not enough flour, you can always add more."

"reviewBody": "Excellent Milk Bread recipe! I have tried a few. I like that it doesn't call for powdered milk, one less thing to stock in my pantry, it has just enough sweetness to it, very soft inside and ha a slightly chewy crust. Milk bread is a favorite of my family and works well as toast, sandwich bread, grilled cheese, or just eaten with a little butter."

"reviewBody": "Hey Chef John! Another food wishes success story (not surprised, every food wishes recipe we've made has been killer!) I didn't have a lot of all purpose flour, so I only used it for the \"starter\" and then used whole wheat flour for the rest of the recipe. I followed the advice of one of the commenters saying that you need to do volumetric measurements instead of weighing the flour by mass- and it turned out excellent! It's so soft, fluffy, and delicious. And not hard to make either! Definitely will be making this again."

For the dough, the wetter the better. I get that - something is wrong with the measurements I'm seeing. I had to almost sextuple the flour to end up with a dough. It just has to be a glitch, but from my given meaurements from allrecipes this is a complete and utter fail."

I also added a tbsp of powdered milk I saw on another recipe. No idea if that changed the outcome at all, but it tasted great. I waited 10 minutes to turn it out and the kids came in because they smelled it, half of the loaf was gone 2 minutes later."

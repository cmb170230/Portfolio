It was watery and the cheese was separated and clumped up into chunks. It looked so unappealing. I will not make this again."

"reviewBody": "This was tasty and I like how the dish browned and how the potatoes cooked in the milk and soaked it all up. But I'm wondering if I did something wrong because the cheese didn't stick to the potato slices -- I did soak the slices in salted water as I prepared them to keep them from discoloring; may have removed too much starch. In any case it's the easiest and least fussy scalloped potatoes recipe I've made that I will make again!"

Then I watched the video (hate to miss those puns, lol) &amp; yes! your mom added flour too. I have a theory: our moms were cooking from Joy Of, McCalls or Better Homes....great days!"

But, the potatoes didn't absorb all the milk! I had some in the bottom of the pan even though I followed chef John's recommendation to add just enough milk to barely cover the potato slices!"

I had a pile of various sized russets, so sliced enough to fill an 8x8 dish 3/4 full with 4 single layers and enough milk to do as the chef advised. I love simple and good home cooking, so thanks to CJ's mom! And ,of course to Chef John for another winner shared with us."

"reviewBody": "I cheated a little - I used my Instant Pot (6 Qt) to sear the meat, sautee the shallots and onion/garlic/tomato paste mixture then deglazed the pot with the broth/vinegar and cooked it on the stew setting (35 minutes) high pressure with a 15 minute natural release. Served it with the Greek spinach rice (in which I used 1.5 lbs of spinach) and my son loved it. Said it tasted even better today in his lunch. I think next time I may use more than one pan to sear the meat just to help the process go faster."

I made this for myself as well as my mother, father and sister and they were blown away as well. I made your spinach rice to pair with it as recommended and man... This was a hit. We will definitely be having this again!"

Asking for the recipe. I topped with sour cream and parsely. It's all Chef John. Have not found a recipe by ChefJohn that is not the best version of how anything is made. Thanks John!"

"reviewBody": "This is good, but I have to admit I was expecting something a little more offbeat, given the massive amount of shallots and the presence of cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. When I made it, the spices all blended into the dish and were fairly muted, and after 2 hours of braising the shallots dissolved. If I make it again, I'll probably braise the shallots separately, the way Julia Child does with Bourguignonne or Coq au Vin, and add them in at the end."

"reviewBody": "This stew is fantastic. Though I can't find a therapist who will help with the trauma I endured from peeling all those shallots. Worth it though - their flavour is great, and I love having them whole. If I could knock off half a star I would, as both my partner and I found the dish too salty. I highly recommend cutting the salt in half, and then seeing later if you need to add more. You can't take it back! Besides the saltiness, the flavour and consistency is divine, hence the 5 star review. As always, I love your videos, Chef John! Can't wait to try another of your recipes."

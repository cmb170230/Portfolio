I added 3/4 of a teaspoon instead of a full teaspoon only because I don‚Äôt like the smell of it. Other than that I made it as is. The only thing I would do next time is to make a larger amount of marinade because that‚Äôs where all the flavor is and it cooked down quite a bit."

"reviewBody": "I made as per the recipe, except I doubled the sauce, enough to season the rice. I did use a pound of shrimp, which was way more than enough for two people. I sauteed the shrimp on both sides with a little of the sauce and got that yummy, dark carmelization, then I removed the shrimp for a minute while I cooked the rest of the sauce. It was absolutely delicious. I probably won't make it again, as it is messy to prepare and clean up. Dinner cleanup is my husband's job, and oh, the moaning and groaning when I leave a mess. Not the type of dish you can make early in the day and pop in the oven just before dinner, which is my (his) preference. üòÅ"

"reviewBody": "These were very good, and next time will be delicious with a small change! I made the recipe as written. It says to heat the oil on HIGH, then cook the shrimp for 2 minutes. I used a timer, and after 2 minutes, when I turned the shrimp over they were kinda BURNED on that side. So the shrimp tasted a bit burned. Next time I'll cook them on Medium High. I doubled the marinade ingredients, and when I added the marinade to the skillet, I also added about 1/3 cup of chicken broth. This made the cooked sauce perfect for spooning over the shrimp and all the rice. The presentation was amazing - especially with the green onions on top! I served it over cooked brown rice with a side of sliced avocado sprinkled with garlic salt. Beautiful and a great flavor combination! Thanks!"

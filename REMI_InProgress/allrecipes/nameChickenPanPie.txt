Store bought pie crust from the freezer and no peas, hubs isn't a fan. He loved this version so will make again. I used a cast iron skillet and it worked out really well."

"reviewBody": "I really enjoyed the flavors and the consistency. I made two small changes to the recipe. I added some sliced mushrooms in with the onions at the beginning. I also cooked it for about an hour at 350 because my pan was not rated for higher temperatures. It probably could have used a few more minutes, but I was impatient. Because of the extra moisture from the mushrooms, it took a bit longer than 10 minutes to reduce. I was extremely happy with the outcome."

"reviewBody": "Mini pies, turkey edition! I used the meat and leftover stock from Chef John's Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy to make filling for 6 ramekins. I cooked the onion, carrot, and celery, then added a cubed par-cooked potato and frozen green beans along with the peas. I had about 2 1/2 cups of meat from the turkey wings. I let the filling cool, then added the top crusts; baked about 35 minutes. Absolutely delicious! We ate them before I got a photo of the finished product."

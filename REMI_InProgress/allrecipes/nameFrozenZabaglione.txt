"reviewBody": "The ultimate home ice cream recipe. Didn't need to adjust any amounts, and it made enough for a party of 6 (with leftover). Using a double boiler takes a lot longer to get the mixture to thicken. Still, it was super easy to make - even when everything went wrong in the kitchen (hotplate stopped working, bowl cracked, didn't have a replacement bowl &amp; had to use a saucepan), it still worked out perfectly! An absolute hit at our dinner party. The other half now wants me to try it with other flavoured alcohols."

"reviewBody": "It was yummy.... but I must have done something wrong in the making! I had to cook over a double boiler for 25 min. And when in the freezer, the Marsala separated and laid on the bottom. It was still awesome and creamy and actually looked pretty cool served. Not sure where I went wrong. Would definitely do again."

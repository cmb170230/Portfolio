"reviewBody": "I don't agree with Chef John that zucchini is not very exciting or fun to eat. I think it is one of the great veggies of summer. I'm also a big fan of tacos. Therefore I fully expected to like this recpice. And I did. I make stuffed zucchinis a few times a year but usually with Mediterranean inspired stuffing using rice or potatoes, feta or fresh mozarella and pine nuts. Zucchini and ground beef (or pork) is always a great combo and this one is no exception. The taco seasoning and slight heat works great with this versatile veggie. My only swap was the cheese. I used a mild cheddar because Pepper Jack does not exist where I live."

I was careful to check the zucchini for doneness several times with a knife point as I loathe mushy vegetables. Pretty on the plate, too. Served with a salad on the side. Will definitely make again. Thanks Chef!"

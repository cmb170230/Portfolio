"reviewBody": "Wow. Thanks for the great snack hack! Can’t believe I made tasty chippies and didn’t even have all the basic items recommended by Chef John. No mandolin?! No problem with a cheese planer. No parchment paper?! No sweat if you’ve got a flexible pancake flipper to scrape off the sticky chips holding onto the plate. Also, didn’t have any russets but Yukon gold were certainly a delightful substitute. Will definitely be whipping these bad boys up again soon!"

"reviewBody": "I've made these three times. A few observations: 1. Red potatoes work well, and have a better flavor than russets 2. You can just use a square piece of parchment on a plate -works the same 3. The hidden valley ranch \"sprinkles\" work nicely as a topping. I recommend spraying with canola spray, sprinkle a little flavoring, THEN microwave so it \"bakes in\" a little."

"reviewBody": "Amazing recipe! So simple, so quick and so delicious! (So easy, even my husband can do it! ;) One Russet potato made a happy serving for two of us, because like John, absolutely no will power when it comes to potato chips! These are wonderful, portion controlled and absolutely perfect with the tuna sandwiches we made using John's Milk Bread Recipe, also fantastic. Yep, two Chef John recipes in one day. That's what you call a good day!"

"reviewBody": "Wow...these are alarmingly good. I didn't know what to expect but I did not expect a perfect potato chip from the microwave. I even had the deep fryer set up but my fears were unfounded. I seasoned with salt and enjoyed with Chef John's Blue Cheese dressing. These chips are unbelievably crispy and stayed that way. I ate them an hour after making and they were still crisp! Will definitely be making these again and playing with seasonings. Thanks Chef John!"

This was a wonderful potato salad that paired perfectly with the roasted lamb. With mint and lemon it was very refreshing and great for a summer evening. It also is vey colorful and looked great."

I love mint in savory foods and I was very underwhelmed. I had two people try it, separately, and get this, they both said the same thing... \"It's different\"."

The lemon and mint make it so refreshing. I used red potatoes and left the skins on, still amazing! This is my new favorite! Thank you Chef John!"

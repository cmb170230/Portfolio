"reviewBody": "I threw my fresh spinach in the food processor to chop up and it didn’t seem to need wilting beyond that. Overall pretty good but definitely needed amping up, including the lemon juice. I also recommend subbing chicken or veg broth for the water (and leave out the salt initially, adjust later if it needs it)."

"reviewBody": "I can't believe more people haven't tried this, because it's an absolute gem. The first time I made this, I paired it with the Stifado. We will definitely make that again once the weather cools. The second time, I paired it with Chef John's Greek Lemon chicken. The next day I put leftover chicken into a bowl with leftover rice for a one dish bowl meal, and that may have been the best pairing of all. I just used water. Lazy Girl particularly appreciated that this has enough vegs to count as a veg side and a starch side, as well as its versatility. Thanks Chef John."

"reviewBody": "Delicious. I didn't have enough herbs to pack tightly but close enough, next time I will buy more. I used the water that I squeezed out of the spinach to cook the rice in. Not sure if that was a genius idea or just disgusting but it worked out the the end. Also tasted nice the next day when cold. I served this rice with Chef John's Greek Beef Stew, another must try!"

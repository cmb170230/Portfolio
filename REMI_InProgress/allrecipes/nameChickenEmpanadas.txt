"reviewBody": "Made these last night for dinner. Have tried multiple empanada recipes in the past that were just so-so.. This one is absolutely a keeper! I didn't have all of the right kinds of peppers, so used what I had. Used 2 cans of chicken breast. Dried cranberries. Mozzarella cheese. Since it was Freezing cold outside, I set the dough and chicken mixture out on our patio for an hour. The ONLY problem I (thought) I had was that I didn't cook all the liquid off of the meat. Turned out to be a good thing, as the sauce was excellent on the empanadas! The ONLY thing I'll change next time is to make them smaller. Took awhile to make, but absolutely worth it!!"

I found that I had to bake them 10-15 minutes longer to brown the pastry as shown in your video - we‚Äôll chalk that up to my oven being old though. Thanks again Chef John!"

Didn‚Äôt want to make the dough and couldn‚Äôt find empanada dough. But the crust was light and fluffy so not too filling. As the food is cooking, you‚Äôll be so tempted to eat it while it‚Äôs cooling. Thanks Chef John!!"

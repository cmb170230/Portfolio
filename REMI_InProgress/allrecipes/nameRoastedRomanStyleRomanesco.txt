"reviewBody": "I really liked this and so did my 3-year-old grandson. He was impressed by the mountainous look of the Romanesco! I did cut the anchovy in half so it would not be so obvious, and it still gave the umami twist. And omitted the red pepper flakes for his sake and instead used a little black pepper. It needed an extra 5 min in the oven. The topping is tasty but not overpowering."

"reviewBody": "I love romanesco and it's a regular cast in my summer cooking! I always welcome new ideas to prepare it but I'm in two minds about this recipe. The flavor profile is great. I might cut back the lemon a bit next time but the combination of anchovis, parmesan, red pepper flakes and lemony freshness works really good with romanesco. But I don't think cutting a whole head of romanesco in quarters is the best way to cook it in the oven. The stem needs a lot longer than the florets to cook through and in the end the whole dish was a quite dry. Next time I would use more olive oil and cut the romanesco in smaller pieces and leaving out the stem. Also, it prefer this as a side dish with something saucy."

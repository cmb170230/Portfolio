I used de-cased hot Italian turkey sausage and made a stuffing using Italian bread crumbs, onions, peppers, egg, parsley, &amp; basil. My stuffing creation was a little looser than I would of liked but other than that they were delicious! The technique was a VERY welcome change to my repetitive fresh pasta recipes of ravioli, lasagna, spaghetti &amp; linguine."

I sautéed mushrooms, baby spinach and baby arugula (squeezed dried) for the frozen spinach and used leftover grilled salmon for the canned. I added more garlic and a bit of nutmeg to the greens mix. Will do again!"

Everytime it has turned out amazing. The pasta has such a good texture and taste. It’s a very versatile recipe. Have fun!"

"reviewBody": "My lack of skill and experience making pasta was my downfall. It was all just fine, except for the tough, rubbery pasta. Not sure if I did a bad job with the kneading (Bad technique), the mixing (too dry), or the baking (the wheels may have been too tightly bunched in the pan). This is our first Chef John recipe that failed to meet expectations, but he did say it was all about technique so I forgive him. After all, I am a disaster at making my pasta."

"reviewBody": "Made this for lunch today with some minor revisions. I used fresh baby spinach since that’s what I had on hand. I also browned the pasta wheels in my round wide Dutch oven, took them out, put the sauce and spices in, then put the pasta wheels back in so I would only have one pot to wash. This turned out much better than I thought it would since it’s my first time making pasta. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Interesting combination of pantry flavors. Had to make my own marinara sauce so had an extra step. Enjoyed trying a new technique. Used my pasta roller and it worked well - four 12x7 sheets. I would cover the dish while cooking to keep the pasta from drying out and maybe put even more sauce in the bottom."

"reviewBody": "Great quarantine recipe Chef John! Made it using almost the same ingredients. The shelves are a little bare. I used only one egg for the filling, we raise Muscovy and their eggs are about 1 1/2 times larger than an extra large egg. We are all out of parmigiana so I was left to use an alternate cheese. Other than that kept it the same. The family really enjoyed the recipe and made us feel like we were out to eat instead of being stuck at home! Can’t wait to try a different filling next time!"

The butterscotch taste was amazing though. Just the texture didn't turn out even after straining. Also for some reason I was only able to fill 3 ramekins."

Everyone seemed to really enjoy this recipe even though mine wasn't quite as thick as it might have been. Again, I think I cooked it a just a little too little on the second to final step. Oh well. Next time (and there will likely be a next time.)"

"reviewBody": "Tastes decadent, rich, but unfortunately grainy, in my attempt anyway. I'm not sure if I didn't whisk fast enough or needed a finer mesh strainer than the one I used, but my attempt was disappointing in the texture department. The pudding also leaves a sort of buttery film over the roof of my mouth. Really appreciate some help or advice from Chef John or anyone else who tries this."

I used chives instead of green onions and I added some of the garlic to the cream cheese filling. They came out fantastic!"

"reviewBody": "Another Chef John success! I was going to do the bread from scratch, but was prepping to host a bday party and was too short on time. So we used store bought rolls. These turned out SO WELL. There were 9 of us and we all loved them. I could have spread the cream cheese mixture out a bit more through the buns (it was a bit clumped in the middle - my bad, I was rushed). Otherwise, perfection! I still plan to try this recipe by making the bread from scratch, and will update my review when I do that. I served these with Tatyana's borscht (do a google search for the recipe - best borscht I've tried!), with a side of grilled asparagus. Excellent meal. One of my guests ate a whole bun (they were big), and snuck another one while she was doing the dishes! So beware... as Chef John says, these are addictive!"

"reviewBody": "Amazing recipe! I did some things differently (since I wanted to get closer to the more authentic recipe, without the buckets of sugar) which Iâ€™ll describe below: - doubled the entire recipe, yielding 15 rolls (my raw dough portions were about 100g each, and I piped about 50g of filling inside each one) - increased the sugar amount in the filling (doubled) and also added a bit of sugar to the garlic butter mixture. - decreased the amount of green onions The results were AWESOME, Iâ€™m addicted to them. Make sure to spread your filling until the bottom of the slits, so the bread donâ€™t become dry. They freeze beautifully, just pack them without the 2nd baking and reheat them in an airfryer or oven. Iâ€™ll definitely be doing this delicious calorie bomb again! Hahaha"

I'll need to work on making sure the inside spreads out more next time, but these were absolutely delicious. Great crunch and flavor. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Everyone loved them. And leftovers are yummy at room temp, too!"

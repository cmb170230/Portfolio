DELICIOUS all the way around. I doubled the recipe to make a full dozen. For toppings I dipped the donuts in melted dairy free chocolate, then in toasted coconut flakes or roughly chopped roasted almonds with a sprinkle of sea salt, or drizzled peanut butter."

The second time, I swapped the cocoa for cinnamon and added a little vanilla. If possible, we liked them even more! Either way, I think these will probably be a weekly bake."

Because of this, I did not bag and pipe it, just poured it in from a spouted container. I dipped the doughnuts in melted 65% chocolate and dipped half of those in chopped pecans."

"reviewBody": "After watching Chef John make these, I needed to try them! However, I didn’t have a donut silicone for them. So, I simply used 6 spots in a muffin tin and subbed paper liners for the non stick spray. Aside from needing to add a minute to the cooking time, they turned out perfectly and had enough dome over the paper to allow for easy dipping into dark chocolate for the same chocolate covered result! The only thing I might do next time around is reduce the kosher salt by half (Morton’s, which I was using, tends to be a bit denser than Diamond Crystal.). Otherwise, a great low-calorie, low carb breakfast snack!"

"reviewBody": "I was excited to see Chef John do a low-carb donut and I promptly made these over the weekend. I've been trying to follow a (somewhat) keto diet since the beginning of the year, so I did tweak this recipe by substituting the maple syrup with 1/4 cup of allulose. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum to help with binding. Although not included in the recipe above, Chef John did add melted chocolate and toppings to his donuts and I used melted Lily's sugar free chocolate chips and unsweetened coconut for my toppings. The results were GREAT! I will say the dough was extremely sticky to work with and I was only able to get 5 donuts out of the recipe vs. 6, likely due to overfilling the donut tins and not being able to get every bit of the dough out of the piping bag. Donuts still tasted great 3 days after baking. Will definitely make again. Thanks!"

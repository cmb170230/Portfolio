"reviewBody": "Great recipe but be sure you really work fast to get the almonds and marshmallows in because the chocolate hardens quick but not sure if I did something wrong because my marshmallows started melting. The chocolate is too hot to work with right from the stove but too hard to work with if you let it cool a bit."

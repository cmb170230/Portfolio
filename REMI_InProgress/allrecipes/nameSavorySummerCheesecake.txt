But Chef John came in right in right in the nick of time with a savory cheesecake that I barely have to modify to make it low carb. This will more than do to replace my favorite dish for the next month and a half. Many thanks."

I would serve a thin piece of this as a salad course or as part of a cheese board with fruit for dessert. This went particularly well with sweet cherries."

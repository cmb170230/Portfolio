Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, occasionally brushing the caramelized bits (side fond) off the side with the hot liquid, until vegetables are nice and tender and consomé has reached desired consistency, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep hot while you prepare the tacos."

Chef John is the man.\n\nNext time I make this recipe, I think I'm going to turn the leftovers into an Enchilada dish instead of tacos. As amazing as the tacos were, they were super messy, both to make and to eat. I feel like they'll taste exactly the same and be much neater to eat with a knife and fork. Either way, this was a truly outstanding recipe and I'm already thinking about the leftovers I have for lunch tomorrow :)"

"reviewBody": "Hi John, I am on a low carb diet and switched out maple syrup (2 syllables) for Lakanto maple syrup (erythritol and monk fruit) which has a chemical taste ðŸ¤ª. Next time I might use 50/50 with real maple syrup which usually does the trick or maybe use 2 tbsp of cream or a nut milk to cut back on carbs. The pancakes have a good texture but tend to crumble, but that doesnâ€™t bother me. They are pretty tasty. It rates a 4.5 when you make it keto."

"reviewBody": "This recipe was terrific. I am eating a Keto diet and was looking for something like this to use the Almond Meal I bought last week. This worked a treat. I used the exact recipe bit added half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder . I also whipped some cream, added a small handful of blueberries and half a dozen chopped pecan nuts and topped the pancakes with these. My only advice is to make sure you cook them well on the first side prior to turning otherwise they just fall apart. Fantastic thank you"

I made the recipe exactly as written, including allowing it to set up ten minutes. I put a little butter and then fresh blueberries on the finished cakes and it was delicious! No syrup needed over the top which is something I always include."

However, I think Iâ€™m just never going to learn to love almond flour pancakes because I wasnâ€™t crazy about these even though they were a huge improvement over other versions. I WILL make them again, but I think Iâ€™ll make them as a general bread/bun substitute for sandwiches and burgers instead of a pancake breakfast."

So, try to eat them pretty soon after coming off the griddle. The taste was good and they were light on my stomach. Iâ€™ll definitely make them again."

Since my Lakanto Monkfruit syrup is like using liquid gold, I replaced the maple syrup with 1/2 teaspoon of organic maple extract,and 1 1/2 Tablespoon of Swerve brown sugar substitute. I used the maple Monkfruit syrup on the almond pancakes after they were finished. Delicious Chief John! I am happy that you're interested in healthier foods.;)"

My 12 yo is a pancake snob, she mentioned they were a bit too thick, so I may thin them out with a bit of almond milk next time. I used avocado oil, instead of olive oil, it's what I had on hand. I topped mine with bananas, walnuts and maple syrup...I had a good time. Will certainly make them again...trying desperately to get my family off of w flour. Thanks Chef"

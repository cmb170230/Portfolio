So this year we made the traditional meal and this at sane time doing some shortcuts like microwaving carrots. We made a small version and it was wonderfully savory! I think this a great meal to use up leftovers too! I'll definitely be making it again. You cant go wrong with meat, mashed potatoes and cheese in a recipe!"

Also, just cooking the potatoes in the corned beef broth makes the most incredible potatoes I've ever had. Thank you! Since I cure my own corned beef, this is rapidly becoming a regular dish here."

Have never boiled a corned beef before or considered using the broth to boil the vegetables. The result was delicious. I used a 1.5 lb corned beef and I would say that that was still a good amount of meat. Used one regular green cabbage head also enough for this recipe. It was a happy St. Patrick's Day meal."

The only changes I made were adding some garlic powder, salt and pepper on top of the cabbage mixture and adding extra cheese to the mashed potatoes (probably 1 1/4 cup total cheese including what was sprinkled on top). I've already been asked when this will be made again."

"reviewBody": "This was super tasty but very labor intensive. I couldn‚Äôt find Savoy cabbage so I grabbed two of the smallest regular heads of I could find on the shelf, and that wound up being about twice as much as I really needed. That‚Äôs my own substitution though so I don‚Äôt hold it against the recipe. \n\nIf I did have one thing to change though it‚Äôd be to ‚Äúfollow your heart‚Äù on how many carrots you really need. I used three as instructed and it was a bit of thought work to ensure that every serving at least got some hint of carrot in it. I‚Äôd have used maybe five or six carrots to do it over. \n\nBut I can‚Äôt argue with the results. Deprived of the bars and parades and other usual trappings of St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, this recipe was part of the stay-at-home substitution and was good enough that, despite the effort, it‚Äôs probably become a tradition in its own right. Just know what you‚Äôre getting yourself into, particularly if like me you don‚Äôt have a dishwasher. I froze the leftover broth to use in boiling potatoes come Christmas or Thanksgiving."

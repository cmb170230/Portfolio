Continue mixing everything with your hands into a shaggy dough. Turn out mixture onto a floured surface and keep kneading until dough is nice and smooth. Add additional flour as needed. Cover and allow dough to rest on the counter for 30 minutes."

"reviewBody": "Ahhh so good, the meat is delicious the dough I can only describe and the inner most pastry layer of a good meat pie(like the type the fits in your hand). I also paired it with a spinach, feta, onion &amp; capsicum salad, kinda just dumped it in the bowl with the broth (coz I don't wanna wash anymore dishes than I have to lol). I feel like I committed some kind of food sin but it was so good, tho next time I'll caramelize the onion."

"reviewBody": "These little bites of flavor are delicious! I made as directed and the only change I made was to top with creme fraiche because obviously. The forming of the dumplings was easier than I anticipated but would probably make them even thinner, especially at the ends. I overcooked them a little bit but even with my errors they were very tasty and maybe better the next day. The husband apprehensively tasted them and proceeded to help himself to many more manti. Will definitely be making these again - they would be great for a party. Thanks, Chef John!"

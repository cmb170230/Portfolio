"reviewBody": "Very nice recipe, crispy outside, moist inside, great for toast and spreading butter, cream cheese or whatever else you like. I have done this many times and it’s my favorite bread recipe because it’s so easy and fault tolerant. You can let it rise even for 24 hours or more and it takes on a slightly sourdough odor which is not unpleasant. All purpose flour works fine. After much experimentation I found that 1/2 tsp yeast works well and produces a slightly lighter loaf. As others have mentioned the dough can be very sticky. This is how I handle it. I combine steps 3 and 4 and put the dough directly on a heavily floured silpat liner on my baking sheet. For the shaping: Make sure to flour your hands. A light touch helps here. With your fingertips flip and fold the dough over and over every which way until it becomes less sticky. To shape: tuck your fingertips under the outside edges and push lightly to shape it into a round loaf. Sprinkle some flour on top. As chef John said it’ll spread out a lot so a compact loaf is desirable. After the 2 hour second rise sprinkle some more flour on top. That makes it look rustic and helps the crust. In my powerful Bosch oven the bread is done in 25 minutes max. I check it at 23."

I sub half whole wheat flour (very finely ground) double the yeast and add just a little more water (because of the whole wheat flour) but otherwise I follow the recipe, and it turns out perfect every time. It is the first yeast bread I've been able to successfully make -- my gateway to the bread-making world. Thank you Chef John!"

I made a sandwich out of it as well. Super sturdy and perfect for finger sandwiches. 10/10 would make again"

I think that it took me about 10 minutes of actual work with a lot of waiting (mix, 18 hour proof, fold, shape, 2 hour proof/rest, bake 20-30 minutes depending on shape). So good, cheap, and easy, but you have to plan ahead. This and an Irish soda bread are my go to recipes depending on how much time I have."

"reviewBody": "This is a good bread for when you want the bread to supply a supporting role, rather than being the star. Its relatively light texture makes it good for sandwiches.\n\nFor those of you dealing with wet, soupy messes, if the dough looked okay after you mixed it, and it didn't turn into soup until you looked at it the next day, it's almost certainly the result of overproofing: the yeast has worked the dough to the point that the gluten is breaking down.\n\nThe most common culprit for this is proofing either for too long or at too high a temperature. It can also happen if you add too much yeast, although you'd have to overdo the yeast by quite a lot to have much effect.\n\nA less obvious reason is if you tried to increase the proportion of whole wheat flour: doughs with a high proportion of whole wheat (or rye) will proof much more quickly than those without. In my own experience, you could probably increase the whole wheat to about one third of the total flour, but at the same time you'd have to reduce the proofing time by a third as well.\n\nIn any case, don't give up! Reduce the proofing time and/or temperature, and give it another shot. You won't regret it."

"reviewBody": "Decent loaf. Easy to make, just like my favorite chef, Chef John, states. Taste was good for how it came out. The only thing I changed was where I proofed and baked. After the first rise, I followed the directions and then put it in an enamel dutch oven to proof and then baked it in there (also after the 2 hour second proof) for 20 minutes with the lid on, then 13 with the lid off. It rose well, and looked professional! When it cooled, it did get more fluffy which is nice, although I like a crunchy crust. It had a nice texture with decently sized holes inside. The flavor is the only reason I removed one star. But I understand this to be a country loaf, so I'm not sure if it's worth taking the star away, but taste is a big factor. Don't get me wrong, we loved it with our cheese and wine dinner! However I can taste a depth of flavor not quite developed in it despite a long proof time. Quite strange... I think I may try adding in some sourdough starter next time and balance the flour out with that to see if we can get the depth of flavor we are looking for."

"reviewBody": "I already wrote a review, but after reading about some of the trouble people were having I thought I might be able to help. I have had a really soupy dough after waiting 18+ hours and this is what has helped for me: use a little more flour on your surface than Chef John did, also, use a bench scraper or spatula. I learned this tip from watching another person make sticky bread. Using a bench scraper allows you to manipulate the dough without even touching it. You can lift up the dough with it and sprinkle some more flour underneath without making a horrible mess. I've probably added up to another cup of flour doing this, but I'm not doing any kneading. When I get to the point where I think I'm ready to transfer it on to the silicon, I put it in a 10 inch silicon cake pan. This way it doesn't spread out so much. You actually end up getting a highter loaf. You are going to be able to see that it was done in a pan with sides, but it does brown nicely on the bottom and more importantly you get wonderful bread!"

I attempted to add flour gradually to bring it back to what the video showed. This took about an hour, a lot of work and really annoying. Nothing like the few minutes it took in the video.\n2nd attempt: basing my assumptions that I did something wrong the 1st, I followed exactly, step by step....18 hours later....ugh. It was even runnier....w.t.h. Again, I ended up adding a lot of flour and time to recover.\n3rd attempt: Let me put my chef hat on and eye ball what I think looks right compared to the video. I started with 5 cups of flour and added 1 cup if water and mixed..adding water slowly. I ended up adding only 1.5 cups of water thinking I was in the clear.\n\nWrong. 18 hours later the dough was still difficult to work with and again, I added a lot of flour to recover. \n\nThe bread tastes good, yet the recipe is not good. Find another."

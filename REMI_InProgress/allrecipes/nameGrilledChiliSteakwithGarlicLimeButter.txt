"reviewBody": "Definitely worth trying! We had trouble with the oil on the meat flaming up. Trying to control that made the meat more charred and smoky, which tasted good but somewhat overpowered the spices. Dry brining the meat made it super tender. The butter is divine! My husband wants to have it again tomorrow! Next time we will skip the oil and see how that goes."

"reviewBody": "I made this with the ingredients as-is, but cooked the steak sous vide and seared it in a cast iron pan to finish. The spice was nicely present, but not overpowering the flavor of the meat. Same can be said for the garlic lime butter. Overall, it's a nice change of flavor from the seasonings or minimalism typical of steak."

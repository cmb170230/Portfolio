I added some onion powder to the sausage instead. Also followed Chef John's notes and used Parmesan instead of Pecorino cheese. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. Put the leftovers in the fridge and they soon disappeared. MAGIC! My kids are already asking me to make it again."

Lol Had a meat sauce going since early morning &amp; trying to decide what to do with it, found this recipe. I do have some mozzarella &amp; ricotta on hand, so here goes nothing. Will definitely take into account what you said about making sure not too dry. The other recipe I've used calls for mixing most of the cheeses &amp; pasta with sauce before pouring into baking dish. Will try your way instead &amp; add some water to my sauce so not too thick. Thanks again!"

My store was out of spicy sausage. -I also added a few cloves of minced garlic a couple minutes before adding the marinara to the meat. -Added 1/4 tsp dry basil with the other spices. -I had goat cheese I needed to use so I added 5 oz of goat cheese crumbled and mixed into the ricotta for some extra tang. -Rigatoni noodles instead of ziti Other than that I did everything just as written and it was delicious! I think using Rao's brand marinara and high quality cheese is really key here. Also it may look like too much sauce but it's definitely not!"

I cut up a few zucchini and used a Chef John method from another video, salting the pieces heavily and letting that draw out moisture for 20 min in a strainer before rinsing &amp; adding them to the sauce mixture for the last 5 minutes of simmering. Flavorful &amp; a little crunchy instead of bland and mushy! Next time maybe I'll stir in a bag of spinach and call it health food."

I doubled the recipe and served with salad and garlic dinner rolls. IT WAS A HUGE HIT! Every single person (children to those in their 60-70's) commented how it was the best they had ever had. Most had seconds and some thirds! The entire weekend, everyone still commented how good it was, and admitted to having reservations when they heard I was serving ziti. Like all of us, ziti are usually dry pile of noodles and tasteless. We even had it for breakfast the next morning. Thanks for sharing Chef John!"

Everything is better with asiago and red wine ;-)"

This is defiantly a family favorite. Of course you can cut the recipe down to a more manageable size, but I do the full service for ten. As good as this was fresh, the leftovers were nothing less than outstanding. Make sure you use a big enough pot for the sauce. It totally filled my 6 quart French oven. I thought it was going to be too much sauce. However, it cooked down nicely."

Other then that, I guess I just have one question for Chef John or whoever at Allrecipes: what do you advise is the best way to reheat Ziti from frozen? I've been cooking large amounts (to share) with this pandemic, and dropping off food on my family or friends porches. Any tips for reheat after defrost?"

It turned out great… Slightly different flavor than we were used to, from the local Italian restaurant but really close. For us, the recipe only needs tweaking but overall, it’s outstanding!!!"

"reviewBody": "Best ziti ever. I'm not a fan of sausage in my sauce, so I cut that down to 2 links of hot. I used one jar of diavolo sauce and a large can of San Marzano tomatoes (DOP). Crushed the tomatoes into the sauce. Used rigatoni instead of ziti, as that's what I had on hand. Spaced 8 meatballs in the bottom layer of pasta. And otherwise made it as directed. Best baked ziti I ever ate."

I also used 1 lb hot Italian sausage and 1 lb of ground beef I needed to use up. As a personal preference, next time I will use all hot Italian sausage. But this tasted great! Wonderful and easy!"

"reviewBody": "This is a wonderful recipe just as it is, but I've made a few changes that my reviewers believe upped the ante.\nI use roll sausage from Seven Sons Farms, one Italian and one Spicy. I use Rao's marinara, two 28 oz jars. Yes, it's expensive. When it goes on sale at Costco I drop in and buy a few jars for the pantry, two jars for a little over $8. Worth it. I add a jigger of good vodka. The alcohol brings out flavor components in the tomatoes without making the dish winey. Water? Oh no, vegetable or chicken stock. Let's not dilute the flavors. I'm not a fan of penne pasta, it's just too much noodle for me. I use Casarecci or Gemelli, something else you'll find at Costco. These noodles hold sauce very well without being 'too much noodle.' \nYes, this makes a big pan of pasta. No problem. I fridge the leftovers, and the next day cut up into portions and pack into vacuum bags. I then have several portions ready for the microwave whenever I'm in the mood."

"reviewBody": "The only change I made was to use cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I actually saw this on America's Test Kitchen when they were making lasagna and they said it had better a little better \"tang\" in the flavor vs. ricotta. I have been doing that ever since. As they recommended, put a stick blender into the cottage cheese and blend it up a big so the curds are not visible, which I always do. I also use 4% milkfat cottage cheese. Much cheaper and works like a charm!\nThe only other change I made was to cut this recipe in half and it was plenty even for 4 people. Baked for only 22 minutes in an 11x7 pan which was perfect size. \nI thought the 24 oz. jar of sauce plus one cup of water was going to be WAY too much for the 8 oz. of ziti I used, but couldn't believe it was perfect! I did use a smidge more mozzarella and parmesan than in the recipe as we like cheese, but basically same recipe just cut in half! \nThanks for an awesome recipe!"

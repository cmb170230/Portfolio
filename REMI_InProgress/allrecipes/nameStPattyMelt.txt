This sandwich is delicious I did however, change the bread I used sour dough, and and at first I couldn’t find the lacinato kale so I settled for regular kale and I was just going to mix that with the mustard greens and then I found lacinato or Dino kale at Whole Food Market so I just mixed all the greens together I also added shallots and bacon and I used Muenster cheese. Now that I have something to compare it with I will make the original but nonetheless mine was delicious even my 10 year old granddaughter loved it."

Will be one of my go to sandwiches.\n\nI did end up using the green parts of the onions though since 3/4 cup is a lot. It could have been the product that I got from my store, but a small bundle (7-8 onions) only yielded about 1/4 cup of whites/light greens. Some of the green parts of the onions got overcooked, but it still came out great!"

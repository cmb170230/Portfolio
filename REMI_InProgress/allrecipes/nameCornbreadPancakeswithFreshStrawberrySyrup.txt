"reviewBody": "DELICIOUS!!!!!! This recipe is great. It works perfectly as is. In Puerto Rico we make the cornmeal cream as a regular breakfast, so when I saw these 'Cremita de Ma√≠z Pancakes' I was quickly interested as sometimes we have leftovers when we make a pot -- and guess what, they work perfectly! The only addition I made is to add a teaspoon or a stick of cinnamon to the cornmeal cooking step. I felt it was unnatural to make Cremita without it! It adds a more balanced depth of flavor that makes the pancakes feel more breakfasty-than-desserty. Make sure you do flatten these with a spoon as they cook. Unlike regular pancakes that naturally start to spread, these will keep their shape. I like to flatten mine a bit when I flip them to make sure they cook through. Great recipe!"

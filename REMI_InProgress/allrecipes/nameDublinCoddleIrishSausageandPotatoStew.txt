"reviewBody": "Delicious²! Chef John makes it look so easy and it is --assuming you complete all the mise en place ahead of time like he does. Prep is the key to success here plus it allows you to inventory all the ingredients and make sure you have everything ready to go. After that you are simply coddling the dish along. I used a few dashes more cayenne than chef John just because that's how I roll. Also I added a couple of shallot to the onion mix. As someone else mentioned watch the salt level as two major components have salt: bacon and chicken broth and the butter potentially. Magnificent stay inside, stormy day dish."

"reviewBody": "Chef John is the only person I trust in this life. I made my coddle exactly as instructed. I will make the following warnings: don't add salt. You can add salt at the end if it's not salty, but the bacon and depending on the brats/sausage you use, your coddle should be plenty salty without adding any additionally. The sausage and potatoes in this were so good, melted in your mouth, and the slight hint of malty bitterness made the flavor more complex than expected. Excellent over all. I used 10 brats since each package of 5 was about 1.35lbs and the recipes called for 2.5. I'm glad I did, because it comes out so tender and good you'll want more."

"reviewBody": "Generally great pointers for building out a bit deeper flavor than one sometimes finds with a Coddle. One way to bring out a bit more authentic flavor direction, especially if good Irish bangers aren't available to you, is to use some sage, white pepper, ground ginger—and definitely nutmeg and mace. Thyme is okay if ya like it yet the former are the common spices for \"the flavor\" of bangers."

My 2.4 lbs of Irish garlic sausage, (which the market had because it's almost St. Patty's day) was 10 links. about the size of the ones Chef John uses in the video. It was delicious, and I expect the leftovers to be wonderful as well."

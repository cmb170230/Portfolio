"reviewBody": "This recipe is delicious as written and also wonderfully customizable. The sausage and mushroom combination is one of the best pizza combos but I can't wait to try other ingredients together. It is great to make ahead for lunch as it holds up well to being reheated. Also, it is very easy to dip into whatever condiment you may choose. This would be a fun appetizer for a party. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "I never made this, but it reminds me of something my family likes to do. We call it tortilla pizza. We put pizza sauce, cheese, and pepperoni on a tortilla, and fold it in half. Then, we cook it in a pan over the stove top. It's so much fun. You can even have a build your own tortilla pizza party with any toppings you could imagine."

I wonder if it's worth it, if they're only 6 bucks each &amp; they'll bring 'em to ya, on nights when I REALLY don't want to cook."

"reviewBody": "Yum. Absolutely delicious and so easy. I followed the directions in the recipe and our pizzadillas came out perfect. I made up my sauce and dough the day ahead (and zip locked each 1/4 recipe and refrigerated it), then let it come to room temperature before we started cooking our pizzadillas. I set up sauce (Chef John's recipe with San Marzano tomatoes and fresh and dried oregano), mushrooms, sausage, onions, peppers, olives (green and black) and pepperoni so everyone could top their own -- with the recommendation NOT TO OVERDO. It was a hit and a lot of fun. One guest did overdo, though -- he just couldn't pass up all the various toppings, which probably would have been okay if he had gone *very light* with each, but probably needless to say, he didn't and it was a little bit of a mess when he tried to fold it -- and messed up the pan for the next person (it was an easy clean). I didn't think to snap any photos, but will next time -- soon!"

"reviewBody": "This was indeed spicy, but manageable for those who enjoy some heat! I made a few small tweaks: Used Texas Pete hot sauce (which is not all that hot) and all-purpose flour. Served with chicken broccoli-flavored rice. Make sure to cook the chicken over medium-high heat. The temperature ensures that the chicken has that delicious crispy texture."

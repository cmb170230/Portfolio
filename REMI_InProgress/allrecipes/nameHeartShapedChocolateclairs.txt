I followed the measurements precisely but after chilling for about 4 hours, while delicious, was too thick. I heated up 1/2 cup of heavy cream the next morning, and added a tablespoon at a time and mixed well. After 4 tablespoons it was the perfect consistency."

I shut the oven off at 25 minutes but think I should have let it bake for a few more minutes. The pastry cream was a snap to make. I will definitely make these again. Thank you Chef John!! We enjoyed!"

"reviewBody": "I ended up making these twice. They're very delicious, and my family thinks so too! The first time I made them, I overcooked the choux at 425f for 30 minutes. Wondering what went wrong, I thought it had to do with my oven running too hot and I was correct. The second time I made them, I was able to measure and adjust the temperature with the oven thermometer (NOT the built in one) for 30 minutes and it baked more perfectly."

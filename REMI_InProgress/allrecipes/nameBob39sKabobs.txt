Thank you Chef John, this recipe is a life-saver! I found 30 lbs of ground lamb hiding in the bottom of my freezer and now I know what to do with it! We made them into patties because I don't like making meatballs, and served on pita bread"

Very flavorful and delicious! We served this with a homemade sourdough naan bread, hummus, assorted olives, feta, and an onion, cucumber, tomato salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. We all ate until we thought we would burst especially the kids!"

But this has got to be one of the top two kofta recipes I have had...and since the other is a secret...the only one I can now personally make at home. Thanks Bob &amp; Chef John for bringing this one to us. I pared the Kofta with Briam (Baked Zucchini and Potatoes - search recipe on this website) and the combo made a perfect Mediterranean meal. BTW...if you can't find the Sumac or Aleppo Pepper in your local store, both are available online. They do make a difference and are worth the effort. Enjoy!"

"reviewBody": "I made this as close as I could to the recipe; I couldn't find Aleppo chili flakes or sumac at my local store, so I'll have to try it again when I find them. I had a larger group to feed, so I used two pounds of lamb and one of ground pork, which worked out really well. I think the flavoring was just about perfect with a nice crust on the outside and plenty of juicy texture inside. I'll definitely be coming back to these kabobs and I'd like to try a few different sauces to accompany them as well. The sauce here was a very simple one, and quite tasty, but I'd like to see how this pairs with a tzatziki or aioli. Great recipe as usual, Chef (and Bob)! I just wish I had taken some pictures before we devoured it all."

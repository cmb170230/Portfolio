"reviewBody": "Very good spread on some coal-roasted veggies. Love the bright lemon and garlic flavor. The weight of potatoes seems wrong; too high. Chef John used a single large potato. I went by potato weight to get 1.25lb (2 10oz potatoes) and the texture looked off from Chef John's attempt. There was a big mashed potato forward flavor in my attempt. Next time I'm going to aim for a single slightly larger potato."

"reviewBody": "We've made Chef John's biscuits and pumpkin scones. They are very good, but this recipe is by far the BEST of the best! If you can't find a giant chunk of white chocolate, grating a small bar is not a good idea. The little shards of chocolate fly around like styrofoam - but it works great in a food processor. These scones are out of this world - they pass the \"fork test\" and taste so amazing. The raspberry aroma filled the house whilst baking as well. We used some leftover shards of white chocolate on top which melted nicely. Please make these, you'll love them!"

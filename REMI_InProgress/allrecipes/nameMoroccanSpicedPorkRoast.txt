I checked 2.78lb roast at 1 hour and it was already 150...so the meat was a little too done for me, but still giving 5 stars because the flavors were all there."

I left the cut open, it took less than 15 minutes and the flavour was delicious. Absolutely nailed the taste! For all those having issues with mixing the honey, put your bowl (heat safe) over a pot of heating water. Thins the honey and allows for better viscosity while mixing the spices and pouring over the meat. I marinated the meat for 3 hours prior to cooking."

The meat was way overdone and the veggies were undercooked. ( yes, I followed the recipe)I won’t make this again, but that shouldn’t stop you from experimenting."

"reviewBody": "This was an excellent recipe. The fragrance filling the house made me wish time would go quicker. If the seasoning mixture with the honey is too difficult to spread, be patient. Place a spoonful on the pork and give it a few (10) seconds or so and it spreads much easier. I don't think it would hurt to go heavy on the honey. That little bit of sweet really pops against the spices. Make sure to spend time really incorporating the honey and spices to avoid getting a granular mouth feel. Next time I will try this by rolling instead of butterflying to give it a nice presentation when sliced."

"reviewBody": "I made this twice and it's a great one-pot meal. I will say both times it cooked significantly faster than the 1 hour 15 minutes it says. I checked my first roast at 1 hour and it was already over-done, but still good. I think Chef John perhaps used a bigger roast in the video than the 3 pounds listed. Just monitor yours. Also, use more honey and it spreads a lot easier!"

"reviewBody": "Marvelous! I followed directions to a T and husband and I were delighted by the flavors of the spice mixture. We were also glad to get a couple of different veggies added to the platter. I cooked extra veggies so we could have them with leftover pork slices. Dry the meat before trying to spread the spice mixture. Don't let the roast cook beyond 140-145 so it stays tender and juicy. I didn't bother with the yogurt sauce--it was wonderful without it."

"reviewBody": "A great recipe and wonderful flavor. The only real adjustment I would recommend is toy around with the amount of honey in the mixture. I found that, with the called for amount of honey, the paste was a bit too thick to get good coverage. Thin it out a bit more with extra honey and don't be afraid to use your hands to get good coverage. It's messy, but well worth it."

My place is a little drafty and I think the honey started solidifying so the rub was more of a sticky paste that I couldn't spread very well."

Definitely a keeper. The only change I'd make is that I'd cook it a bit less next time -- it was lovely and juicy when we first sliced it but by the time we got around to seconds it was a bit dry. I'll take it out of the oven at 140 degrees next time."

And a half of a small head of cabbage, chopped up. And cut up some golden potatoes with the skin still on.\nAnd, I did it in my Instant Pot. It worked flawlessly, as usual.\nI especially like using the I P because it's harder to burn the roux and paprika with it on saute.\nAften all the initial prep work and saute, I set the pot on soup, for 20 minutes, then let it rest for 25 minutes.\nThe potatoes were perfect, as well as everything else."

I only had plain, ol’, regular California paprika and I used spicy smoked kielbasa For four servings, it says 6 oz. of sausage but the kielbasa package is 14 oz. Since I wanted to use the whole package, I doubled the recipe and felt the sausage to soup ratio was kind of light. Also, when I watched Chef John’s video, it really looked like the same amount as I had, using the whole package. In any case, the flavor of this soup is amazing! I’m planning to freeze half to pull out in a couple of weeks when I’m running low on groceries."

"reviewBody": "This is a very good soup. \n\nThough it's not the Traditional Hungarian Potato Soup I was taught by my Grandmother. I'd suggest investing in some real Sweet Hungarian Paprika it's taste is cleaner and sweeter than what you can buy in American Supermarkets. You will also notice it's redder than the kind we can buy in stores. To make it last longer, I keep mine in the freezer. It helps keeps it fresh. There is also smokey and hot Hungarian paprikas, so make sure it says sweet.\n\nYou can also add some diced green pepper to this recipe and if you use a can of rinsed sauerkraut you'll have Hungarian Sauerkraut Soup. Also leave out the Bay leaf, use apple cider vinegar and no salt needed.. My grandmother told me white vinegar is only good for cleaning up pet messes to keep carpets from staining. So we only use Apple Cider Vinegar or Red wine vinegar in my home.\n\nIf you'd like your soup on the thicker side the make a rantash (roux) of oil &amp; flour that you slightly brown, take off stove add some crushed garlic. Then add to your boiling soup and stir."

"reviewBody": "Delicious. I skipped the bay leaf, black pepper and flour because I forgot them - I did not miss anything in the taste of the final product because of this. I used a whole cabbage since I had an old one in the fridge that I wanted to use up. I substituted apple cider vinegar for plain distilled vinegar, and andouille sausage for Hungarian sausage since it was all I had on hand. I added Hungarian Peppers since I had some in the fridge. I also eyeballed everything from memory because my internet wasn’t working at the time so I couldn’t pull the recipe up. Inspite of all that, it was absolutely delicious! The vinegar at the end and the sour cream garnish really add something remarkable to this dish - do not skip them. Thank you Chef John for a delicious and foolproof recipe!"

I also used malt vinegar instead of white vinegar and it gives a great taste to the soup. I was afraid 2 tbsp would be too much vinegar but it is just right. Thanks for the recipe Chef John!"

I served it with Mexican corn bread. Garnished it with sour cream and green onion. We did not share it with anyone! Next time we'll make enough for friends. LOL! Love Chef John, ENJOY."

The hubby recommended a can of lima beans next time. Served with a wedge of cornbread. The vinegar at the end with the cabbage makes me think sauerkraut."

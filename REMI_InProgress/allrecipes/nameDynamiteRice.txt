"reviewBody": "I made this according to the recipe. It turned out great! I added a tiny bit of my special teriyaki sauce to the rice and on top to contrast with the sriracha sauce. Be careful when doing the broil. One to two minutes is plenty. There are so many variations you can do with this recipe. I’ll be making this again."

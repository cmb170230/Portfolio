I followed the recipe with a couple of minor edits: I didn’t have walnuts on hand so I increased the chocolate chips and cherries a bit and I did not use the frosting. The loaf is so moist and delicious! I love the flavor combo - something new. I ate is as dessert last night and with coffee for breakfast this morning."

It didn't seem to go with the cherry flavor even though I usually like that combination. I made it in 3 smaller pans and adjusted the baking time accordingly. I also substituted almonds for the walnuts just because of personal preference."

"reviewBody": "The combination of cherries, chocolate, and walnuts is delicious. I followed the bread recipe as written (I did use chocolate chips), but instead of the glaze, I sugared the loaf pan (same method as flouring a pan, but use sugar instead of four). That gave a slightly sweet taste to the browned sides of the loaf. I served it for dessert, but I'll make it for a brunch soon."

A photo is attached, but we've already been into the loaf. It's almost gone! Next, I think I will try his Banana Bread recipe."

Since there are only 2 of us I made 4 small loaves( this changed the cooking time to 40 mins.) I absolutely love both cherries and chocolate and this is the “ bread” for you! Glad I made small loaves or it would all be gone! Yum!!"

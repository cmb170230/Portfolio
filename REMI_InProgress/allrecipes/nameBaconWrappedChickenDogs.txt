If you want a little more crisp to the bacon just pop it under the broiler after baking. This is part of our regular repertoire now. Highly recommend!"

"reviewBody": "Loved it! A bit biased because I'm a big CheJoFa (Chef John Fan) and I like (almost) everything from him, but I can honestly say I super loved this, as did the people to whom I served it. By Chef John standards, it was really quick and easy to prepare, which was a nice bonus, but I loved the flavor and taste. The pairing with BBQ sauce was an excellent touch. I'd definitely make again. \n\nI didn't use the bun or jalapeno but I'm sure that would have made it even better. Thanks as always Chef John!"

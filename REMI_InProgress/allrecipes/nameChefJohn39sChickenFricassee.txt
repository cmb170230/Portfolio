This was the first time I watched one of chefs cooking videos and frankly, I don't know how I managed any of his recipes in the past. I tend to rush my cooking and I'm sure I would have never had that good sear if not for his patient videos. I cannot wait for the left overs tonight."

"reviewBody": "This is a delicious stewed chicken dish, perfect for a cold winter night. I made the recipe as written, however, ran out of chicken broth so I substituted with beef. The result was an extremely moist and tender piece of chicken with a flavorful mushroom sauce. I served over egg noodles with a spinach salad. I think I would add more head to the sauce by increasing the amount of cayenne. It was an easy dish that I will definitely be making again. The husband said the mushrooms were the star of the show. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Thank you, Chef John, for another wonderful recipe. Besides doubling the recipe and smashing the meat chunks with the back of a wooden spoon against the side of a bowl (I do not own a potato smasher), I followed the directions exactly. The meat was tender and sweet. I liked how this was quicker than an all-day pork shoulder in a slow cooker. If you're short on time, you could probably skip cooking down the liquid because the meat tasted amazing before this step. But of course, Chef John knows how to make over-the-top dishes, so I follow his directions. Next time I am going to remove the fat from the cooked chunks of meat while the liquid is cooking down because my family is sensitive about fat texture. Made for 4th of July. My family loved it!"

"reviewBody": "These chicken fingers turn out incredibly moist and flavorful. I don't like to get the deep fryer out unless I am really going for it and these did not disappoint. They were great on top of the salad (even though I secretly was wishing for ranch to dip them in). The husband had them with barbeque sauce and cheddar cheese on a bun. He was thrilled with the result and almost didn't mind the smell of the fryer oil. I thought there would not be enough batter sticking to the tender but they came out with the perfect amount. I really think the hard apple cider added lightness and flavor so I suppose I will just have to hide one in the pantry. Thanks Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "It's always so gratifying when a recipe turns out so well. Because we are on a low sodium diet, I omitted the salt. I didn't have any canola and used sunflower seed oil. I browned the fingers after coating them and finished them in my table top convection oven. The meat turned out so tender! I will definitely make this recipe again and can't wait to experiment with onion rings and other veggies. A very solid 5-star."

"reviewBody": "To answer the question about self rising flour, you can make your own by adding 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder to 1 cup of all purpose flour. I have used ginger ale as a beer substitute before, with favorable results. For recipes where you want a more neutral flavor, club soda is a good option."

I make my crust in a 10\" cast iron fry pan, which seems to brown the bottom better. I make one pizza with pepperoni, and one without. This recipe accommodates different tastes well."

"reviewBody": "Thank you, Chef John, for making me feel like a pro once again. This pizza turned out amazingly. I made the recipe as is, except I used salami instead of pepperoni. The dough came together beautifully - I did not need to add water nor flour (just gave it some time kneading). It lifted easily off my surface and onto the pan. The cornmeal dusting on the bottom of the pan was brilliant. What a great touch. I made it using Chef John's pizza sauce recipe, which was also perfect. The crust came out nice. I was worried it would be soggy or flimsy, but it was just the right amount of firm. I don't see the temperature in the recipe write-up, but it's in the video. He says hot 500 degree oven for 15 minutes, which is what I did. I also impatiently waited while it cooled a bit on a wire rack - I recommend the wait, I think the crust turns out better. I only used one half of the dough, and put the other in the fridge. Not sure if it will work out the same after it's sat 24 hours... guess I will find out tomorrow, and I will let y'all know. I'm also going to throw on a few more toppings - not too many - and see how that works out. This recipe is a keeper! Super easy, super yummy. What more could you ask for? UPDATE: I baked the 2nd half of the dough 24 hours later. Put a little more sauce on, salami, chopped anchovy fillets and sliced black olives. It was SO GOOD. Crust turned out great! Photo is of this one."

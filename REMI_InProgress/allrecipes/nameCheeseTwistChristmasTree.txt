"reviewBody": "This is very easy to make and makes quite the impressive presentation. The one caveat is to not use a very ‚Äúwet‚Äù pesto. I had on hand a jar of Costco pesto, while flavorful, was much too oily for a pastry filling. The result was excess oil pooling at the bottom of the pastry. Other cooking notes are that a pizza wheel really makes cutting the dough easy, and my pastry was done in 15 minutes."

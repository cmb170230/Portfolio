"reviewBody": "So good! I coated the bigger berries in flour to prevent them from sinking and also scattered some on top. A fair amount still sunk to the bottom, but lots of them stayed suspended. I also had set the timer for 50 minutes, but ended up taking it out about 7 minutes early because the top was getting pretty browned. It was definitely done, even at 43 minutes. But overall it was really yummy and would probs be great with some whipped cream, ice cream, or maybe served with a little melted butter on top. Definitely going to make this again!"

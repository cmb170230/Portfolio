Second time I made it I had fresh jalapeños so two went in, finely chopped. This was even more deliciouser (it's a word NOW, okay?), and it's on the favs list. p.s. I only had 1 lb of b'less thighs left, and the local supermarket was out. Don't sub breast for the thighs. Too dry."

"reviewBody": "Usually I stay away from BBQ chicken bc it tends to be dry. I almost invariably opt for the BBQ pork for that reason. But, listening to the Chef's mellifluous tones, I thought I might as well give this one a try. I am quite glad I did. This recipe was excellent. I had recently picked up a ten lb bag of frozen, skinless, boneless chicken thighs from the local restaurant supply house which was convenient. I used an orange pepper instead of green, since that's all I had. Also, I have been growing my own green onions which is actually easy to do, and quite handy. Anyway, I put the final product on buttered, toasted Ball Park Everything Burger Buns. I resisted the temptation of adding some extra Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. And it was quite tasty. I ended up eating two samiches and honestly I could have eaten 4. I will 100% be making this recipe again."

It was ok, meaning my family ate it, but I’m not looking forward to leftovers. It wasn’t bad and there is nothing negative I can point out, it just wasn’t noteworthy or very appetizing."

The recipe is 5 stars just how it is written but I have started to add some extra BBQ sauce and a splash of liquid smoke to the mix. This will be a go-to now since I keep frozen chicken thighs and everything else is typically in my pantry anyways. Bravo Chef John, you never miss."

It only added 10-15mins to the cooking time and an additional splash of water to keep them submerged. Taking the bone out was easy but finding the cartilage in the meat wasn't. But yeah 10/10 would do it again."

Prep was quick and easy too, perfect for a weeknight. For a bonus, I added butter, garlic powder and grated parmesan when toasting the hamburger buns for some garlic bread sloppy chickens. Definitely will be making this one again!"

In fact, I might add just a smidge more brown sugar next time. Paired this with Chef John's Classic Macaroni Salad and it was awesome!! Thanks, Chef John"

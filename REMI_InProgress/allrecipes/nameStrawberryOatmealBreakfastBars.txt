So I put them in instead of the strawberries. And. My hungry baker sorts... it was delicious. So don't be afraid to punt. Put jam or conserves or whatever you have. Mine came out like a superlative oatmeal cookie crisp. Vanilla ice cream would have been fab. Someone ate that to. Me. But I didn't eat the berries. Not all of them."

I stressed about getting the first one out, but lo and behold it popped right out after it was cooled completely. I used my steel bench scraper, it has a very sharp edge, to cut and pop them out. I also used my 7 x 11 baking dish."

When i finally made it, it was so easy i wondered why i put it off so long. \nSo, the main thing, i forgot brown sugar so the only sweetener was probably less than a 1/4 sugar in the strawberries. And honestly? Pretty good. My strawberries were very tart but i only missed the sweetness a little.\nI also made this in a 7x11 pan for thicker bars are i personally feel like that was a good choice.\nI also browned my butter a bit instead of just melting it.\nI also ate a piece warm and was dying to slap a scoop of ice cream on it cause it would have been perfect. But it was still a solid snacc to eat on its own, very enjoyable."

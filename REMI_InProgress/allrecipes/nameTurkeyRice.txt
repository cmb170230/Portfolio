"reviewBody": "This is an absolutely terrific dish. In fact, it's so good my daughter requests it sometimes. And if we cannot find turkey, chicken works as a decent substitute. Just make sure to roast it first-- and keep in mind chicken breaks down faster than turkey, and so I lower the times. As for too much salt, the problem the other reviewer probably had is she used table salt when the recipe calls for kosher salt. The difference in that would be profound. Also, some broths are naturally salty and you have to take that into account. The bird itself may add some salt, depending on how you cooked it. Either way, you should know how salty you like things, and so it's wrong to put a one-star review on a dish you messed up. Fixing it with lemon juice is pointless. Add more (salt-free) broth, more rice. It would even out some. Anyway, if you hate cilantro, like me, parsley works fine here. As do red or green bell peppers if you dislike heat. Some shredded carrot added at the beginning might add a little color and veggie action for the kids. This dish is really worth giving a shot. It won't change your life, but you may find yourself craving it, even when it's not Thanksgiving-time."

My very picky 8 yr old gobbled it right up. It's easy enough to make on a regular basis using chicken or just picking up turkey wings &amp; drumsticks at the store."

"reviewBody": "This is a great way to use up turkey in a way that doesn't remind you of Thanksgiving. My husband doesn't like leftover turkey, says it has a taste, but he loved this dish.\nI just had one turkey leg and made half the recipe. I did have to add a lot more broth than expected, but I am pretty sure it's because my pot let out a lot of steam so the broth evaporated. I added more broth, used 1/2 cup rice, and it still worked out great. If you don't want to use the suggested topping, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on my rice and it was a nice addition."

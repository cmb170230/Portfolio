"reviewBody": "I did use this recipe, and I am sure it is tasty just as written, but I did throw a few additions in there. ;) First, along with the onion, I put a minced clove of garlic. As I let that cool, I added the seasonings TO the buttered onions, thinking it might blend with the salmon better. I used the cayenne, Worcestershire, and lemon juice- PLUS some dill, lemon pepper, lemon zest, and @ 3 T of dijon mustard. After adding the cracker crumbs ( I used Ritz since that is what I had) and mixing well, I added the butter blend and mixed thoroughly again. Whipping the egg whites definitely gives this a light and airy texture which I loved about it! I baked 2 mini loaves, but also tested using this for a salmon cake that was crispy and delicious. I served the loaves with a mango, pineapple, avacado, and diced spring onion salsa. That light tropical topping went perfectly with it. I will definitely make this again.... and SOON! --- THANKS for your great videos, Chef John!!"

It was easy to put together (I didn't even separate the eggs), and my husband and I both loved it. I'm so glad I now have something to make with convenient cans of salmon."

I doubled the recipe and added celery with the onions. I also added a little old bay! It was really good. I did the whole egg white folding in, and probably won't next time. I'll add the eggs in scrambled like I do with most meat loaves."

"reviewBody": "We like salmon patties, so I was looking for a non-fried recipe and came across this one. It's honestly very similar to the salmon patties, just instead of frying, you put the mixture in a pan and bake. As I do with salmon patties, I sautéed as many veggies as I could get away with and added them to the mixture--spinach, mushroom, garlic, onion, bell pepper, squash. I didn't bother to separate the yolks from the whites--just mixed it all together. Kids loved it and I did, too. However, I wasn't a fan of the left overs the next day. The kids still liked it reheated, though!"

I also reconstitued the Worcestershire sauce from a powder a local spice merchant carries, using a roughly 1.5:1 ratio of water to powder. And instead of saltine crumbs, I used crumbs from pieces of Cheez-It crackers.\n\nI don't understand what the problem with looks is; the loaf looked fine and tasted great. Another excellent recipe from Chef John, who is a real fount of great recipes here on AllRecipes."

"reviewBody": "I love this recipe. My Mom used to make salmon loaf back in he 70s. As always with Chef John Recipes, this is a huge improvement. I made a few substitutions (nothing big). My husband and I live with my parents to help care for my Mom who has Alzheimer's. I made a couple substitutions to accommodate my Dad. (He suffers from old-man curmudgeon disorder and lifelong inflexible personality disorder.) Also, my 21 year-old son is sheltering with us, so I doubled the recipe. That worked out fine. My substitutions:\nI only had one small onion (and it was beginning to sprout)! I used that and some freshly minced garlic. I added a little dried parsley \"for color.\"\nMy Dad refuses to eat canned food. Also, Because of the meat plant issues, my husband loaded up on ground meats this past weekend (and left it all in the refrigerator instead of freezing some). So, I substituted 2 pounds of ground pork for the canned salmon. (My son refuses to eat fish, so that worked out well.\nFor a little \"flavor boost,\" I replaced some of the crushed saltines with grated parmesan cheese (the kind in the green bottle).\nI didn't have vinegar or lemon juice, so I left those out.\nThe menfolk pour catsup over everything, so I didn't bother with cocktail sauce.\nThe salmon loaf was a HUGE hit. I will DEFINITELY make it again. It's. literally. fantastic!"

"reviewBody": "We love Chef John's Salmon cakes, so I figured I would give this recipe a try for a change of pace (especially since we have been eating quite a bit of canned salmon recently! ). Once again, Chef John did not disappoint! This salmon loaf was really delicious. I made the recipe just as written, using lemon juice in place of the rice vinegar (since that type of vinegar is not a staple in my pantry). The loaf turned out perfectly and had a very nice texture. I served it with a dill &amp; caper white sauce, which complimented the salmon flavor quite well. Chef John's video is also well worth watching - the tips are very helpful, and you can't help but chuckle at his humor. Thanks Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "This is good enough to make even when you're not sheltering in place. The only other time I ever opened a can of salmon, I was so appalled by the bones and skin, I spent a long time picking them out. This time, thanks to Chef John, I mashed them right in and he's right--you cannot tell they're in there. The only change I made was to limit the butter to 2 tablespoons instead of 4. Per Chef John's suggestion, I served it with a white sauce. I goosed the flavor of the sauce by heating the milk with a slice of onion and a bay leaf, then strained it into the roux. Added salt, pepper, cayenne and a dash of nutmeg. Oh, and because I was interrupted, after it finished baking, the loaf sat in the oven for probably about 15 minutes with the heat turned off, which may have contributed to the lovely delicate crust it had."

And be sure to use Chef John's technique of separating the eggs to whip the egg white and fold it into the mixture. It makes a really wonderful textural difference in the finished product!"

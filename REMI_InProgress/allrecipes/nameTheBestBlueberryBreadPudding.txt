I have to add that the search engine on this site is really bad. It isn't a good recommendation when you have to go out of the site and use Google to find what you're looking for."

"reviewBody": "Love this recipe. The custard is spot on, yummy. &amp; savory with the lemon zest, cinnamon. I followed the recipe to the letter, and what I found was that the 1 lb of stale bread was not really enough bread to cover the bottom of the pan. I used \"Inked Organics Bread Co,\" Rosie's SF Bay Sourdough Bread (I love its' strong sour qualities). It's from Costco. 10 slices gave me a little more than 1 lb, but I had to add 4 more slices to do the job. Fortunately, there was plenty of the yummy custard to thoroughly saturate the last 4 slices! Also, using this bread did not take 3-4 hours to dry, it took only about 45-60 minutes. I can se using this custard recipe for french toast and who knows what else. \nAfterall, I AM the Colonel Mustard of Chef John's Custard!!"

"reviewBody": "This was a lovely recipe. I made as directed, except that I successfully substituted (thawed) frozen blueberries for the fresh blueberries. \n\nWhile the crusty, buttery top was lovely, and more formal looking, I preferred the delicious, custardy goodness that was underneath it. Next time I will chop all the bread and forego the extra steps of the fancy top layer. \n\nWhen all was said and done, we had ZERO leftovers and all thumbs up.\n\nI recommend this recipe. Thank you for sharing it."

It's so perfect that hubby says if it's any better the 2nd time he won't be able to stand it. This is definitely a keeper."

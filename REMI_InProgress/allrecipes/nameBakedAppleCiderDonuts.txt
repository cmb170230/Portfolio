As others have mentioned, the flavor was light. Good, but not \"bam, Apple!\" The cider was not especially flavorful, so that may be the issue. I would give these a go if your looking for a treat. Took 2, maybe 3 hours start to finish. That included the wait times for cooling and the amount of time it took to cook down the 2 cups cider to 1/2 cup."

Reduce the sugars down to 1/4 c. granulated white and 1/4 c. brown sugar and these would allow more of the cider &amp; spice flavor through. Makes a good coffee cake with diced apples included. Not for donuts."

They look beautiful, too. I tried to upload a photo, but the web app does not like the size of my photo. They looked very much like chef John's. I did go with the cinnamon sugar topping, which added a nice crunch to the moist, cake crumb."

Tried filling the donut wells just slightly over 3/4 full and they looked great but were a bit dry. Then tried filling them all the way to the rim and they puffed up so much that the sides didn’t look nice but the donuts turned out lighter with a better crumb."

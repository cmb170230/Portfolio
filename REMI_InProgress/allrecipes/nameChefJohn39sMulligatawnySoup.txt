"reviewBody": "This was amazing! Everyone including the 6yo was going back for more. I am out of gram marsala so I subbed in pumpkin pie spice and a little extra curry. Also missing celery but added a little seed and bouillon with msg. I went heavy on the tamarind using a block of pressed pulp and it added a nice acidity. Anyway, it's a soup so lots of room to play around but I got pretty darn close. Thanks for turning me on to this one! The naan was a perfect pairing to make a full meal for 4 big eaters with leftovers"

I was intending to make a casserole, but got distracted by chef John! It was just fine, but I think the thighs would be just right. The breast meat was not succulent."

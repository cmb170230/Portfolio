Truthfully, I'd be ashamed to ever buy it again in a common grocery store. Watch out, Italy! Blue-eyed red-head is coming for you! :-)"

Anyway it came out great! Ricotta is getting stupid expensive in Hawaii so just bought a gallon milk and figured I'd make ricotta and IP french yogurt. Using my hm ricotta for pizza and a pasta sauce So glad I made extra!"

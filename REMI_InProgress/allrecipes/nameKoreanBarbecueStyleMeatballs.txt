I also used Bison burger meat for the meatballs and I think that was also not what I was looking for. But I know the recipe is very good and I will make this again with the 85/15 beef like Chef recommended. I will also use the recipe for a glaze on other Asian stirfrys for that rich flavor. Thanks, Chef, for another winner!"

"reviewBody": "We, like many families, keep on eating the same few meals, and although good, it becomes boring. This dish was really great, and even my fussy husband said it was delicious! Others have said it was too spicy hot-- my son and husband said it wasn't that spicy. That is so hard to guage as people have such different palates. I thought it tasted great. I would double the recipe and keep some for leftovers. Once you have all these ingredients out, why not make more? FYI: 1) READ your ingredients before starting. I had to run to the store for a few things and I have a well-stocked kitchen. 2) If you are looking to make something real quick, this isn't it, but the time put in is worth it. Also, having a \"Food Chopper\" from the Pampered Chef will certainly help to expedite the process. I used it to chop up the garlic and crackers. Also, I used ground sirloin which did NOT produce any fat but the recipe turned out great anyway!"

"reviewBody": "The recipe was great, but definitely your timing estimating was wrong. This is one putsie preparation. First of all most people do not have these ingredients readily available. I do because I sometimes cook Korean food, however knowing this. I would highly advise on cutting back on the hot sauce because I followed all the instructions and it was too hot. Most people would not eat it. I should have known better when it said 1 T., red flag right there, this stuff is very hot. It was. Dry tasty and I would do it again, ut cut down on the hot sauces, both of them."

We both really enjoyed this flavor profile so much that I intend to create a Korean BBQ burger in the near future."

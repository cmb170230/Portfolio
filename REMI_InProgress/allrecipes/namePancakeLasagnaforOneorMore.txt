"reviewBody": "I'll NEVER make traditional lasagna again. I've made this dish at least a dozen times and it's always delectable. I never dreamed lasagna would be on my regular rotation list... but here I am. Skip the Jack cheese and go w/ traditional mozzarella. Ricotta isn't available in my pueblo, so I sub with Goat cheese, add some sauteed Italian sausage or sauteed mushrooms. Garlic salt is a must-add as well, IMO. So as not the heat up the house, I actually bake these in my gas grill under indirect heat. I'm really not exaggerating when I say this lasagna changed my life! Thank you Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Because I didn't do individuals but rather a small pan, I had to go back and modify this recipe so I could make heads-tails of it; was very confusing to me. I did make double the pancake batter and thus I had enough for 3 full layers and a top. Wish I had had time to make double the ricotta (yummy!). Next time I will make cheese the day before. As it were, thinking ahead I managed to have things ready in proper order. Also included a meat layer of ground beef and ground pork which I cooked ahead of time with added Italian seasonings. I had sauce in my freezer but it needed more sauce... even if on the side. (I had to keep it warm for late comers and it got a bit dry.) I didn't have the Monterey Jack cheese but I will next time! I did use mozzarella as well as the homemade ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Loved the pancake noodles; made for a light lasagna. They did not taste like crepes nor pancakes. Family and Italian guest said was very good! I do love John's recipes and funny anecdotes! Will be creating this again and freezing individuals."

I subbed in my own flour and made the crepes, then layered it with my own ingredients. It was stupendous! I cannot thank Chef John enough for giving me this life-changing idea."

Did 4 minutes per side and 2 on each edge and they came out perfect. Used the brat buns. served potatoe salad in the side. Delicious. Thanks for another tasty recipe!"

"reviewBody": "wow! who knew hot dogs could be elevated to another level and so simply. Bacon wrapping technique worked like a charm too. Had this with Amish potato salad and this was more than enough. I made 6 of these and we could only eat one each....\nFor tailgating I could see cooking these and then cutting in half and using small buns for a perfect sized food especially since most of the time you've got tons of other snacks alongside. Highly recommend."

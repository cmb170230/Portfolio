"reviewBody": "Chef John!! Another “WOW” recipe! Doubled (but only 3 TBLS sambal oelek) and since I didn’t have chili peppers, used diced red bell pepper. I also added the cooked pork somewhere between step 4 and 5 and ended up using about 1/2c pasta water. This was so good!!! My husband thought a tad too spicy but agreed that the flavor was amazing! Easy and better than any takeout! Thanks again CJ!!! Will absolutely make again!!"

However, the one drawback of this recipe is that it doesn’t reheat well. Next time I’ll make all the pork topping and only as much pasta + sauce as we expect to eat for that meal. Also think it could stand a bit more hoisin."

"reviewBody": "Yummmm. Made the recipe exactly as written, but I doubled the pork mixture, tripled the pumpkin sauce, and used a full package (16 oz) of bucatini. I used canned pumpkin which made it super easy as well. It came out super delicious!! I agree with the other reviewer that the noodles alone were meh, but with the hoisin pork it was perfectly balanced!"

My only regret is that I didn't make a larger batch so I could eat it for the next week. I personally seasoned to taste and added more gochujang, garlic, and chile peppers to taste."

"reviewBody": "Sweet, spicy, wonderful. We used the canned pumpkin puree and Chef John was right, it was phenomenal. We originally tasted the noodles by themselves right out of the pan (don't judge me, we're obligated to do such things when cooking noodles). By themselves, the noodles seemed too spicy and unbalanced. However, once the pork mixture was added on top, it was magically perfect. It's almost like Chef John knows what he's doing."

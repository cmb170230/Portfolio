Cook until the tortilla is as browned and crispy as you like, 2 to 3 minutes."

I used canned potatoes to cut down on the cooking time. My only non stick pans are omelet pans, so I trimmed my low carb tortillas to fit. I was able to do the wrist flip like I do for omelets to easily turn it over. I did spray the tortilla on top with some Pan to give it a little help browning because my pan was pretty dry. I also followed other posters tips and added the cheese after the eggs to help bond to the tortilla."

"reviewBody": "Would definitely make this again. Very versatile, easy, delicious and beautiful. I had leftover baked potato so I chopped that up browned it, then added mushrooms, onion and a little chopped broccoli. I even forgot the cheese but didn't miss it. I was out of bacon, too, but it still turned out so good. Topped w/Asian hot sauce, sour cream and cilantro. The toastiness of the tortilla is a big improvement, as is the egg mixture being bound together. Will definitely make this for guests and family."

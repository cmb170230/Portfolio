"reviewBody": "I had no idea what this would be like...but I trust Chef John. So I went out and bought Wondra flour but I did not buy enough and just supplemented with ap flour. When I put them in the water they looked very similar to Chef John's but what emerged was a small planet. I was very devastated because I was pulling out my Bohemian Orange Chicken to serve atop my small child size dumplings. However, I pressed on and sliced a few dinner plates and fried them in butter. I let them get a little darker than Chef John but they tasted extraordinary. They are wonderful on their own but when you add the chicken it becomes a remarkable meal. The husband informed me he was interested in having this weekly. Thanks Chef John!"

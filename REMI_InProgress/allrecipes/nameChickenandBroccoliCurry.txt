"reviewBody": "I made this using boneless chicken thighs, and did not toss the chicken in the spices, but sautéed the spices to let them bloom as I usually do with Indian dishes. The ratio of cumin seemed high to me before making it, but decided to follow the exact portions to see if I discovered something new. This recipe was fine, but lacked the complexity I'm used to when I cook Indian cuisine. I think it would benefit from adding something like cardamom and ginger, and decreasing cumin. I love spice, but the cumin flavor was too dominant in our opinions. The sauce is thin, but perfect for serving over rice."

"reviewBody": "I made Chef Johns chicken curry and broccoli today for the first time and My wife and I loved it! I like the fact that I had most of the spices to make the curry combination of spices and I followed the recipe pretty much verbatim. The only issue I had was my fault not having enough broccoli. I did substitute some frozen broccoli it wasn’t much of an issue. In the future I make this again and I will to plan to have more broccoli but also ensure that they’re not over cooked as they were a little bit soft. I love the flavor we had it over a bed of rice it was one of the best dishes I’ve had in a long time."

Broccoli florets hold the sauce so wonderfully. \n\nTo note: occasionally I may look up the history of a wine, bourbon, or dish of mine that is a favorite. If I want AUTHENTIC then I'll work to find it, but if my favorite bourbon is made in California, I'm not going to care much. I'm just going to enjoy something I found that tastes good."

The sauce is very flavorful - earthy and a little sweet due to the addition of the ketchup, but it's not overpowering at all. The flavors mesh really well together, and there's nothing to complain about. Definitely becoming a staple in our house now."

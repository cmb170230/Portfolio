"reviewBody": "Oh, wow. I saw the video while hungry, and IMMEDIATELY went to the store. This was absolutely amazing! We didn't just use crostini for ours; because my family ate this as a meal, we used sandwich rolls, and it was DELICIOUS.\n\nInstead of cooking our own chicken, I got some chilled rotisserie chicken breasts from the store. Since we didn't have pan drippings from fresh-cooked chicken, I didn't drain the ricotta, and it worked very well. I think I used too much chicken, though, so I ended up having to add another 1/2 cup of sauce.\n\nPlease make this. You won't be disappointed."

This recipe is simple, quick and easy to make! Great comfort food!"

I bought Armour Sliced Beef in a jar and did as the recipe said: I just dropped and stirred it into the gravy. Holy cow, was it salty! So salty we could barely stand to have one slice of beef with the gravy on bread...so salty it was mostly inedible. So, then I read reviews which say to rinse, or even boil the dried beef, with one reviewer saying this is a CRUCIAL step. I agree! Or, do as others say and use the deli sliced beef sandwich meat instead."

My second helping I warned up leftovers with some Worchestershire sauce and a little bit of seasoned salt. There's the depth I was looking for!

If you're using jarred dried beef (which is way, way better than the refrigerated packaged stuff like Buddig), you really MUST rinse off the salt before adding it to the sauce. I always add a sliced hard-cooked egg or two. Sometimes I'll add curry powder. My mother used to add peas if she made it for dinner and served it on Holland rusks. I like it on crusty bread, split English muffin or bagel halves, all toasted."

I also don't have a toaster so I toasted my bread in a pan, (Lewis Texas Toast slices), with 1-2.5 tbsp of butter for each slice. My rule with griddling bread is that you keep it on medium-high heat and know when a side is ready to flip when you push it with the spatula and it is stiff (and the color is right, obviously).\nThe serving size was perfect, and even though it is very filling (due to the milk and butter and meat over bread lol) I could eat this as long as I have it, full or not. So next time I will be making a large pot of it, and also making a ton of toast in the oven so we can have leftovers :)"

Time in the Chipped Beef saddle has given me the chance to play around with the recipe (but not too much! It's a classic, after all). I like to make it a little richer with a splash of half-and half in the milk, and I have changed up the seasonings with a little dried rosemary or a favorite steak seasoning. It serves up very nicely over English muffins or a stout artisanal bread."

The first time I made it is seemed like it was missing something. I added a little white sugar to it and it turned out awesome. I may try the nutmeg suggestion tonight."

This recipe is super easy if you've made a roux before; if not, don't despair abut it not thickening immediately. My experience is that a roux needs to boil then as it cools down, it thickens. Hubs likes this gravy more than I do; I tried it and thought it was palatable, but he really likes this type of gravy and finished it all! I call that a success. Thank you for the recipe."

I did not add any salt to the recipe and it was fine. I‚Äôm going to add a small can of sliced mushrooms next time. Drained or undrained. Just adjust milk. Enjoy!"

The only differences being we do not use cayenne and it is much tastier if you fry the beef in the butter. After it starts to curl and darken, remove it from your skillet and make your roux in the flavored butter. Perfection."

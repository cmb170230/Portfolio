"reviewBody": "Darn! I wish I had read the other reviews--it was quite overseasoned, and I like salt a lot! I toned down the salt on my mashed potatoes to even it out but it was still a bit much. Texture was nice--I added a couple teaspoons of ground flax for extra binding power. The edges were aresome and crunchy. My husband who hates veggie loafs said \"good first pass\". I may try it again, may make patties with it instead so i can get more of that crunch."

"reviewBody": "Wonderful job Chef John! I couldn't find black lentils so I used green, but the taste was fantastic. That Worcestershire sauce really helps boost that true meatloaf flavor. I despise tomato glazes on meatloaf so I skipped that and served it smothered in brown gravy with homemade mashed potatoes and garlic Parm roasted brussel sprouts. I definitely enjoyed and will be giving it another try soon. :)"

"reviewBody": "I swapped out the oatmeal with brown rice and added it to the food processor with the lentils, and it was not as crumbly. Also, I agree with the others that there was too much salt in it and took their advice, so I omitted adding the beef base and any extra salt, and used coconut amino instead of soy sauce. I am on a low sodium diet so must alter recipes. It still came out very good."

"reviewBody": "Loved the texture-- mine looked exactly like a beef meatloaf. My almost a vegetarian daughter and a little more picky husband loved it too. My only complaint was that it was really salty. We only had seasoned breadcrumbs which have alot of salt in them, I salted my lentils when cooking (do not do this), parmesan cheese, beef base, soy sauce, you salt the mushrooms to draw out the liquid (salt, salt and more salt). I would not suggest adding any extra to the recipe when you combine all of the ingredients before baking."

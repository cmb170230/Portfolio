We ate it in buns with some lettuce and a bit of mayo. Great texture and flavour! Did it on my gas grill with 1/2 med high and the meat on the 1/2 at low temp. Took a bit longer than the recipe to hit 160, but worth it."

Marinated in spices overnight, broiled for 10 minutes one side and 7 the other side, that was plenty for tenderloin even though I’d sliced it a bit thicker than specified. The whole family loved it."

Recommend trimming as much fat as possible: Mine had a few small pieces of fat that were very chewy."

It was so tender it took literally no effort to thread onto the skewers. I served this with regular baked potatoes and corn on the cob and it got 5 out of 5 thumbs up. I didn't change a thing and look forward to making this again. Thanks for the newest hit into my recipe rotation:)"

We used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and also tried a gochujang sauce. Both turned out well, I might prefer a spicy smoky sauce the next time or maybe a little more pepper in the rub."

I had a little problem with sticking on my gas grill even after oiling the grates, but it was worth it. Even two out of three verrrry picky kids liked it!"

"reviewBody": "Due to several reviewers saying the temp was too high, I did a test, and found the time/temp to be accurate. These are supposed to be dark brown, and if not cooked long enough, the inside may be on the raw. If some of you have a convection setting in your oven, this can also cause things to bake and brown much faster, so you may need to adjust your temp down, or cover brioche with foil for the last half of the bake."

I make croissants a couple of times a month. 25 minutes at 400, tented with foil the last ten minutes produced beautifully dark muffins, burnt black on the bottoms (cups) and all had to be thrown away. Completely burnt. 425 for 25 minutes is WRONG. Must be 375 for 25 minutes."

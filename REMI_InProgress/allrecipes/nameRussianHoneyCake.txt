I added a little vanilla to the cake mix and I made it gluten free by using Bob Mills cup for cup flour. It turned out amazing! I used foil sheets on the cookie sheet for ease of removal so it’s doesn’t stick. It worked well. I will most likely make this cake again!"

Just the right amount of moisture, a fairly subtle sweetness compared to many other cakes, and shockingly light too--you wouldn't think it from any photo."

"reviewBody": "This was a big hit at a family party. Not too sweet, moist, great honey flavor but still light and delicate. And WOW! Does it look impressive!!! I let it sit for 2 days before cutting. First piece came out perfect! I referred to another reviewer's tip and used 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. I traced an 8 inch paper plate in 2 spots on the back side of the parchment. Flipped the parchment over, and spread the batter up to the line visible on the right side. Use a large muffin scoop, about 2 heaping scoops of batter for each round. The layers turned out pretty even. Use all the batter to make rounds and choose the best 8 rounds for the cake and the rest for crumb. Measure and spread each round as you go so the batter doesn't get dried out and harder to spread. Once baked, I pulled the whole parchment sheet off the pan and onto a cooling rack. I used a batch and a half of the frosting. Next time, a batch plus additional quarter batch would be plenty. Measure it out to ensure even layers- a heaping cup per layer and use a little extra on the edges if the cake seems low in spots. You want to build it up in order to keep it as level as possible. I opted to crumb the whole cake. Let the crumbs cool all the way, then zip them to very fine in your food processor. The finer the better for this cake. Thanks for a great recipe. I will be making it again, its already being requested!!"

But i didnt like its taste. It was like all the normal pastries we buy from a bakery. And it was not moist enough.. like all the effort this cake took. My family liked it but I didnt like it that much. As i have baked alot of cakes. They all were flavorful, moist and delegant. This looks beautiful and its fun to bake. But just not upto my expectations. While i was cutting the cake i could feel the knife was going through each one of the layer. It shouldn’t feel like that."

"reviewBody": "Turned out great! Forgot to add the cold water to the burnt honey after it cooked, but just heated it back up and added it with no problems. A crucial step! \n\nHad JUST enough frosting and crumbs for a beautiful cake. This recipe leaves no room for error, unless you want a 7 layer cake lol (still impressive). The egg mixture was hard to gauge the temperature of... it felt not so warm when I just stuck my finger in... but when I moved my finger tip around in the batter, it felt almost HOT! Since this recipe is not measured by weight, I probably added a TAD too much flour, as my cakes were only slightly denser than I thought theyd be, and my batter was slightly thicker than Chefs in the YT video. I used parchment paper in lieu of a silica mat (they are basically the same thing), I guess the paper is less environmentally friendly, but it worked like a dream. The whip cream frosting is DIVINE with that burnt honey flavor and slight zip you get from the sour cream. You could put it on boot and it would taste good. Between the burnt honey in the batter, frosting, and toasted cake crumbs on the sides, there are many layers of honey flavor in this cake. If you are biting into this cake expecting anything other than honeyliciousness, you still wont be disappointed. Beautiful cake, first time making it."

But it seemed to make the batter really thick, so will try exchanging some of the sugar for more maple next time.\n\nThis batter does not stick when baked at all, in my experience. A greased baking sheet works fabulously.\n\nSubstituting the sour cream for yogurt also worked fantastically for me."

"reviewBody": "Oh my goodness, this is so good. I made this for my husband for his birthday and it was worth all of the hands-on prep, even with our 9 month old scrambling around at my feet the whole time. My advice to other people who want to make this cake is to not stress too much about perfection- it will turn out and it will be good. I used a double boiler-esque situation for the batter instead of putting the bowl directly on the burner. I spread 1/2 c of batter on parchment and aimed for an 8-9” circle and baked two layers at a time for 6 min. Then after cooling for a bit, I trimmed them using a 9” cake pan. The frosting is sooooo good with the burnt honey. This cake was a hit and our friend said it was the best cake he’s ever eaten! I’m glad the prep was worth it! And it’s so big, it would easily feed at least ten people with big slices, or probably 16 people for skinnier ones."

"reviewBody": "Very fun to make, and taste is quite unusual and not overly sweet which was great. \nTook me about 3 1/2 hours, baking 2 rounds at a time. \nHad trouble with the honey, going by smell alone was too confusing for me and I wasn't sure when it was caramelizing and I went by colour, still not sure if I should have cooked it a bit longer. \nI reduced flour by 1/2 cup as others suggested reducing flour, and I'm assuming it was because batter was too thick; at the start it's fine but as it cools it thickens up quick and becomes harder to spread. \nDid not have any silicone mats and used parchment paper and used a 9\" pan to draw circles that I could then spread onto. I understand why mats would be way better - parchment paper slides around and makes spreading really difficult but also it was nice that i could just lift them off the pans when cooked and replace with new ones. \nMade an extra half of icing, did not use all of it but I also eyeballed the cups for the centres so I maybe didn't put enough, the end result would have benefited from a tad more cream. \nQuite a large cake, putting the crumbs on is very messy and I still got crumbs everywhere when I unwrapped it. A great cake though, I didn't find it difficult just time consuming, and everyone thought it looked very impressive."

I had a really hard time spreading it thin enough to be able to do the 8 layers and got 5 dense layers instead. The flavors are on point and the cake was still incredible, but this was the struggle I had with it. Also, this recipe really made me appreciate a double oven and enough pans to keep the process moving smoothly."

After refrigerating overnight the cake was really good, a few spots where the frosting was a little sparser were dry which is why I would recommend making 1.5x the frosting recipe in the future. The texture feels similar to firm lady finger in a tiramisu to me and the flavor is very subtle, I got the honey flavor from the frosting more. Would make again! Was really fun to make a cake using silpats and I think from now on I will make all my cakes 8 layer on silpats because the frosting can be more evenly distributed through 8 layers and it gives that perfect frosting to cake ratio in every bite! Thanks Chef John! :)"

"reviewBody": "The worst news is the cake has to refrigerate overnight. Mine is sitting in the fridge and the whole family is pretty upset it won’t be ready until tomorrow.\n\nOne tip, the crumbs should be super fine and dry and fluffy in order to cover the sides using the method in the video. I thought mine was pretty fine but not fine enough. The crumbs didn’t bounce back like in the video and it wasn’t light enough.\n\nThanks chef John. Glade to match a face to the voice and hands."

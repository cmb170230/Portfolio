I have made this more than once, both leaving the skin on, and removing it before prepping and roasting the turkey breast. I prefer it without the skin. The spice rub works better that way, and losing the fatty skin is an improvement here."

The flavorful rub and moisture of this breast made our turkey sandwiches the perfect choice for a too hot to cook meal. Maybe a turkey chef salad tomorrow."

I made this turkey chef John and it's so much delicious that I can't stop commenting to myself on how joyful I am. \nEverything is just perfect except that maybe as for my kids I'd rather add even a bit less of a black pepper because even an amount of it alone mentioned in this receipt is enough to make this dish spicy.\nJust to mention that I made it with just a raw piece of 1.5kg cut off of the whole 3kg turkey half breast, no skin, no bone."

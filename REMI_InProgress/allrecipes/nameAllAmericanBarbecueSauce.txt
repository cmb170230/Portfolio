Brought to boil &amp; then fridged overnight before using. Makes a perfect glaze for pork ribs as is. I'd play with the sugar &amp; cayenne if making as a table sauce, it could use a little more of both I think."

"reviewBody": "As the title says, classic All-American BBQ sauce. I've made it three times now. Because my store doesn't have 2 cup-sized ketchup bottles, the regular 20oz bottle is just a bit more I just use it all now, and it gives me a container to deliver the goods later. I think the flavors meld the best after hearing to a summer. Funnel back into ketchup bottle when done. \n\nOther tweaks to consider:\n- add Sriracha for a garlicky heat\n- too sweet? Add Soy and Worcestershire Sauce\n- want smokey? Add a 1/4 tsp liquid smoke\n\nOnce you make it the regular way, you'll want to experiment. Set out some ramikins and try adding pinches of different ingredients to see what you like."

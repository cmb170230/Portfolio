"reviewBody": "Thank you, Chef John, for sharing this recipe. My family was working from home on Halloween while recovering from Covid and had no plans for fun. Thankfully these meaty little ghosts helped cheer up a glum day. I followed the directions exactly as written. They tasted and looked great. Loved the blood sauce. The video was helpful and amusing! I filled up after eating one ghost, but other family members ate more. Served with mashed potatoes and gravy. Next year I might serve with linguine or fettuccini."

"reviewBody": "I used my regular meatloaf recipe, but followed these directions. They didn't turn out so cute, but whatever, they were scary nonetheless. I did most of the ghosts as real meat, and a few alternative beef, which did pretty well. May attempt next Halloween and hope for better looking results! The \"blood sauce\" was something to remember!"

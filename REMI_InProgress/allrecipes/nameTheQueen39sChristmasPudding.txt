"reviewBody": "This is the second year in a row that I made this recipe. My family loves that it uses a blend of dried fruits we eat regularly rather than the candied cherries and peels found in American fruitcake. The recipe is easy to follow and I like how Chef John gives helpful hints to make this pudding a success. This year, I didnâ€™t have oranges, so I substituted the zest and juice from half a grapefruit. The tartness of the juice didn't change the flavor of the dish and my pudding turned out delicious. I also steamed my puddings (the mix was so voluminous that I used two pudding moulds) in my slow cooker. My house smelled so good the last hour of cooking! I'm planning on making this pudding again next year."

"reviewBody": "It's a nice recipe, great taste and smells very well. Despite living in the UK for over 17 years, I never thought that one can actually make a Christmas pudding from the scratch. And that on Christmas eve, which is even cooler :) There was a surprise in the end - this pudding is quite large, it's about 1.5 kilos :) I followed all the prescriptions except replacing whiskey by cognac (just could not force myself buying bourbon in the UK...) but I guess it doesn't make much difference. Also, decided to skip the maple syrup, since wanted to give it to my one year old. What I always appreciate with Chef John is that you always get what's promised."

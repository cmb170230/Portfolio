"reviewBody": "This has become my go to recipe that I have recently been making all the time. I love the way these pancakes turn out, flavor and texture, my friend said they are the best pancakes she has ever tried. There are a few changes I make. Even if you don't like to alter a recipe you will find, as others noted, you will have to at least double the milk. I made these the first time because I had bananas to use up, so I have always made them with two big bananas instead of one. Maybe as a result, I find it works best to use two eggs, and recently have been using vegetable oil instead of butter for my dairy allergy daughter. I also use a dairy free milk and the last two times used a few tbsps maple syrup instead of sugar. (The more moisture the better with this recipe, I even go a little light on flour) Finish with chocolate chips and crushed pecans, a little cinnamon mixed in the batter. Seriously the best pancakes"

"reviewBody": "These were really amazing! I needed to add twice the liquid the recipe called for, though. Maybe because I was using buttermilk, which is quite a bit thicker than regular milk. Adding just a 1/4 cup was way too thick and doughy. Pancakes are all about batter texture. It takes some practice to get it right. Highly recommend using buttermilk for all pancake recipes though. I also add up to a tablespoon of cinnamon to all pancake batter. Even a little allspice or a dash of nutmeg give it a little extra interest."

I only used 1/4 cup sugar and upped the milk by just a splash, they were so delicious! Very quick and easy to put together, my new favorite pancakes! Thanks Chef John, never disappointed with your recipes."

"reviewBody": "I have made this a few times as written, and once with a mixture of flours because I ran out of all-purpose. These pancakes are addictive!\n\nI want to share my Goldilocks observation:\nWhen using one banana, if it is a very ripe huge banana, the batter will be looser. If a huge not-so-ripe banana, it contributes too much fluid and needs a little more flour or else you end up with runny batter. Small bananas which are very ripe do not contribute enough fluid and the batter will resemble brick-layer’s cement or spackle (or possibly sticky bread dough) — you need to use a spoon to poke it into a round shape in the pan to get a pancake of even thickness. Still tastes good.\n\nIdeally you use one slightly over-ripe medium banana, or two small very over-ripe bananas. Nothing fancy, just the generic yellow bananas found in American supermarkets. Just right!\n\nToday I used 1 and 1/2 super-ripe medium bananas that had shrunk on the counter as they aged. I added a bit of extra flour, which was not necessary. I poked the pancake batter in the pan with a wooden spoon, just a little, to hasten the shaping. Perfection!"

"reviewBody": "As others have noted, the batter is way too thick. My first pancake was a mound of batter, it wouldn't settle into a flat disk under its own weight, and no bubbles could work their way through, so I burned the first side waiting for them to appear.\n\nI about doubled the amount of milk in the remaining batter, resulting in something thick but pourable, and the rest of the 'cakes came out delicious."

I, like other reviewers, had to adjust the milk. 1/4 cup of milk was not enough for the batter to be manageable and I struggled with getting them to cook properly. Tripling the milk to 3/4 cup worked for me. Now to decide......Is this breakfast, or dessert?"

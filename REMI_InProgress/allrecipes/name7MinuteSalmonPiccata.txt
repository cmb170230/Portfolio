"reviewBody": "This recipe produced a very tasty piece of salmon. I am usually not a fan of capers but wanted to try something different so I marched on and made the recipe as written. I only had to substitute rose for the white wine. The result was excellent. I would probably still cut down on the capers for personal taste but the sauce had wonderful acidity and made for a great lunch. Thanks, Chef John!"

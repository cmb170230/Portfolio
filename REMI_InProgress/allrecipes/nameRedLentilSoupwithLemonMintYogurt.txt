Also, added some diced mushrooms with the carrot and celery. But the mushrooms did not add anything really, so not sure I would do that again. But the curry powder was a great addition imo. Love this (Picture wont upload for some reason but still amazing)"

"reviewBody": "Made it exactly as the recipe called for. My tomato paste didn't look like the one in the movie when it was cooking, maybe I didn't put as much as Chef John did or perhaps my onion amount as larger. In any case, I struggled to watch it turn to that red brick color as it was cooking. Nonetheless, the final product came out fabulous. I ground my own cumin in a mortar and pestle because I find the flavor is way bolder than with the store bought stuff. Will definitely make it again, a nice change from the brown/green lentil recipes I have made in the past"

Though have to say, not a fan of the sauce. Maybe it was the yogurt I used, but something wasn't right about it. We just topped ours with a dollop of sour cream and Aged Italian Cheese Blend...so, so good! Another Chef John winner recipe. Thanks!!!!"

I had the heat on a little low and the carrots were a bit firmer and not mushy... preferred it that way. Flavors were better the next day, but carrots got softer."

"reviewBody": "Easy, healthy. One thing, though -- 30 minutes is a long time for this simmer uncovered -- it will reduce all your liquid. I simmered for 15 minutes partially covered, -- shut off heat and just covered it to finish softening lentils. Or, you can add more stock. Grateful I had all ingredients. I get a lot of mint during summer -- I clip, rinse and freeze in vac paks to have on hand. Red lentils are great because they have none or less skin hence they do cook quicker."

Place 1 tablespoon crab filling right in the center and press to spread it out a bit. Pull the bottom wonton corner up and over the filling, line it up with the top corner to form a triangle, and work your way down the sides, pressing and sealing the wonton edges and pushing out any air. Press your finger right in the center of the long side to create a fold (or bend) in the triangle. Moisten the 2 &#34;wings&#34; and fold around the bend to seal. Repeat to form remaining tortellini."

Maybe some garlic and butter or butter and lemon instead of a creamy sauce would be more to my taste. The tortellini needed longer than a minute for the wonton wrapper to cook where the ends are pinched together."

(After you have hunted through several stores and finally found creme fraiche for nearly $5 for a tiny cup, you will see what he means about making your own for a fraction of the cost! Like almost all of Chef John's recipes, he demystifies \n and demonstrates how easy the creme fraiche technique is for the home cook.)\nI've made this tortellini a couple of times and I now make double the dumplings and freeze half. Thaws well so all you have to do is cook and sauce. Thanks again, Chef!"

AND the main reason for 4 stars, it was relatively expensive and cumbersome to make…. However IF you get crab cheap and WANT a fun meal to make with spouse/kids etc then yes 5 stars is worth it!"

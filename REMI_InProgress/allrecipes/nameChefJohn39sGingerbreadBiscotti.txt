We love ginger however so next time I might up either the ground ginger or the crystalized ginger just a smidge but not sure which yet. (leaning toward the ground ginger but might do a tiny bit of each) Don't be afraid of the ginger in this, even for those who are wary of ginger's heat this is mild and goes extremely well dipped in coffee or tea or even just as is ... YUM!"

Worried that there would not be enough white chocolate but there was more than enough. Received very positive reviews from the family and will put this on my Christmas baking list."

"reviewBody": "Excellent biscotti recipe. I really recommend watching the video because it gives excellent guidance. I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting out about 1/3 of the brown sugar (so used about 1/2 cup instead). With the molasses, candied ginger and white chocolate glaze, it worked out perfectly for sweetness. Love the little “bits” of candied ginger in this. Please do not skip this as it really makes the cookie amazing."

"reviewBody": "These are delish and worth making just for the fantastic smell while these are baking. I did make some minor changes to the spice mix; I cut the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp and added 1/4 tsp of allspice and 1/2 tsp cardamom. I didn’t have white chocolate, so I lightly drizzled the final biscotti with some cinnamon-laced powdered sugar glaze on top. I’m not a huge fan of crystallized ginger, but it is the star in these cookies. The granddaughter gave this 2 Thumbs Up."

Ever single one of his recipes I have tried is 5 stars. \n\nSubstituted the maple syrup for honey (because thatâ€™s what I had) and had to adjust my time for a larger roast but this was the best roast I have ever made. Perfect combination of spicy, sweet and savory with a nice crunch from the pumpkin seeds. Give it a try!"

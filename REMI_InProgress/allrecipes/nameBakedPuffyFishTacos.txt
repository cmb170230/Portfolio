"reviewBody": "This recipe is not getting enough love. Chef John is right. The texture on a lot of home made fish tacos is wrong because they lack sufficient crunch. These tacos are easy to make. The fish cooks and the flour tortilla crisps up at the same time. The tortillas add just enough crunch to round out the dish in a way that I love. By the way, you can also just crisp up the flour tortillas using the same technique and add something like shrimp, cooked separately, and the toppings. The folding is always a little tricky, but after a couple of tries you will have it down and fish tacos become an extremely easy meal to make."

"reviewBody": "The recipe creates beautiful pastry dough and wonderfully tasty beef that cuts like butter. I made this for new years eve dinner and several people said this is the best fillet they ever had. My lesson learned is that 6oz sized fillets is a better portion size and make stretching the dough around the fillet easier. Using a thermometer takes the guessing out of when the meat is sufficiently done. The recipe is not difficult but I underestimated the prep time. I will practice the recipe again soon."

The mushroom pate mix was fantastic! The additional bread on the bottom isn't necessary but does make for a better presentation....and tastes good too! Next time I'll have to make the pan sauce for that extra element!"

"reviewBody": "Our butcher recommended individual wellingtons as each person gets a better crispy portion of all, so we thought we would try it. Excellent recipe and easy if you follow the excellent video step by step. Many steps can be made slightly ahead, so as not to rush at the end. The meat turned out exactly as planned...for all palates. We tried the pate and it was all good. Chop the mushrooms very fine to get result like the video. We found that we could share one, as we tend to eat smaller quantities and didn't need the extra pastry...but can see where some might like having it. Excellent!"

"reviewBody": "I don't like black pepper or hot spice so I eliminated those ingredients. I should have also eliminated the mustard which I don't like. It overpowered the taste of everything else for me so the Wellington wasn't' elidable. Everyone else liked it though. I would also eliminate the pate. Again, most everyone liked it but it's not for me.\n\nThe portions are WAY to huge. Next time I'll cut each fourth of pastry in half to make eight \"bases\" instead of the four rounded pieces as shown in the video - why waste any of the pastry! When the Wellingtons are done and are cut in half, there will be eight servings (half of each Wellington on a \"base\").\n\nThe puff pastry made from butter (not the Pepperidge Farms brand) was $13/sheet! Next time I'll make my own. Martha Stewart has a good recipe with a video.\n\nI couldn't find his recipe for the brown sauce he talked about in the video so I made mushroom gravy. He also has a recipe for mushroom gravy.\n\nWhen cooking mushrooms, I always preheat a cast iron skillet on the highest heat on my stove then put the mushrooms in and cook them until the water evaporates. Then I add the butter, shallots, garlic, celery root, and anything else.\n\nI plated with steamed green beans, carrots (like the ones shown in the video) cooked in my asparagus pot, and small potatoes cooked in my electric pressure cooker. \n\nLoved the video instructions and commentary!"

Follow Chef John's instructions and it will come out the way it's supposed to. \n\nIt's getting 3 stars from me though because I did not like the mushroom/pate mixture and this is a flavor that you can't get away from in this dish. So, it's not bad; it's just not for me.\n\nPortion size was way too much for me as well..\n\nI also made the pan sauce that we never got the directions for but were promised in the video -- but easy to look up elsewhere. I served this with a store bought kale salad because I like kale salad and I didn't want to cook anything else today.\n\nIt's a very heavy meal."

"reviewBody": "Excellent! Just follow instructions and you’ll have an easy and elegant meal. So nice to be able to prep everything ahead of time. Two tips:\n\nI tossed multicolored baby carrots and quartered honey gold potatoes in olive oil and seasoning and put them on one half of sheet pan and my four Wellingtons on the other half. Baked it all same temp and same time and it made for a nice side with just one pan to clean up. \n\nAlso, because of Covid we had Christmas dinner separate from my mom. So I prepped a 5th Wellington filet, and I tossed the veggies with oil and seasoning in a ziplock. I delivered them in an aluminum pan to her, and we both put ours in the oven at same time and ate together on FaceTime. So, would make a good meal to take to a friend or family."

I even added a few drops of truffle oil just to make sure the truffle flavor came through. I also used red wine instead of white wine (it's all we had) and a bit of garlic to the duxelle. I didn't make the pastry base as I thought it was too much pastry and it was absolutely delightful. Very rich, I would serve 1/2 an individual wellington per plate."

We made 2 individual 6 oz fillets and because of the richness from the puff and pate, we decided that next time we make these we probably only need to make 1! I am also not sure the extra puff disc is needed as there is already a ton of pastry- more than if you had made the whole tenderloin. We served with carrots and potatoes like Chef John which were absolutely delicious as well!"

When I first began making this dish frozen puff pastry wasn't invented yet! Believe me the pastry available today has made this a cinch. Just buy the best tenderloin filets you can find (and afford). The mushroom \"Pate\" is super easy and can even be made the day before."

Follow the directions exactly and it'll be a hit. I cooked mine for a rare/medium rare to his time specification and it was perfect. The mushroom and pate mixture was incredible! \nI wonder if laying a layer of pastry on the top and one on the bottom, then trimming and binding them on the sides would work so that you're not having to stretch the pastry at all would work? I have no idea. Either way, mine turned out perfectly. And I enjoyed having the extra puff pastry on the bottom."

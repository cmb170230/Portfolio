"reviewBody": "For the last 2 days, hubby has been asking me to use the overly ripe bananas to make banana bread!\n\nThanks to the August heat, the bananas ripened too quickly but I was reluctant to bake him bread as the oven heats up the kitchen. So your microwave banana bread recipe was ideal: Delicious and Easy! Only wish I used a larger mug as it did overflow. \n\nI was reluctant to try the recipe as nobody had written a review but am so glad I took a chance. After all, I’ve made several of your other recipes that turned out amazing. Thanks for saving me all that time and sweat in making a very tasty treat!"

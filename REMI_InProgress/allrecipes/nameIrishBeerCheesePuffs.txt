"reviewBody": "These came out wonderful, i tripled the recipe and baked 24 of them, freezing the other third. I don’t even enjoy beer but this was delicious! Next time i would bake/cool them for less time (my oven runs hot). They’re extremely light and airy, with a flaky, warm, cheesy inside. the aroma was amazing. I also replaced the mascarpone spread with cream cheese and still tasted super good. great recipe Chef John!"

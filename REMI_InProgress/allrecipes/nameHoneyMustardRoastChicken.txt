"reviewBody": "This chicken was absolutely divine... The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet, tangy, and savory with a hint of heat. I had two issues, however...\n1. My chicken took so long to cook! It took over an hour to get it to temp. I ended up finishing it by broiling the top. Absolutely amazing! Broiling it seemed to have made it super juicy. I thought it was raw at first, but I temped it. It was perfect. The meat was so tender.\n\n2. I put too much chicken broth in the sauce. So I reduced it until it was a nice consistency and it was perfect.\n\nI served with roasted potatoes and freshly steamed green beans. Out of this world. Best chicken I have had in a long time.\n10/10 would make again."

"reviewBody": "So much flavor! I followed recipe ingredients exactly, upping the marinade amt. for a 5 lb chicken. Marinated 5 hours. After 50 min. I turned down oven temp to 350 to finish, a total 70 min. The drippings were delicious stirred in the boiled marinade, made for a lovely sauce. Super moist breasts, caramelized skin. The juices were blackening so much which is why I turned temp down, and the chicken released more as it rested. Gotta have it for the sauce. I didn't add any salt at all and it was fine. It's great when you can make a delicious dish from easy ingredients from your pantry. Add a fresh chicken and you have a scrumptious sweet and spicy dinner. Smiles all around. Thanks CJ ."

"reviewBody": "I’m obsessed with this sauce. It’s really versatile, too. I didn’t marinate my chicken; I just used leg quarters and brushed the sauce on at a few stages during roasting. I also had some leeks and a couple of red potatoes in the same pan which got cooked in all the chicken and sauce drippings. Since I didn’t use the sauce as a marinade I was able to dip my potato wedges in it without any extra cooking which I think is THE move to make this more of a one-pan situation."

I'm not a huge fan of mustard so I didn't like pan sauce but the actual chicken was fantastic. I turned the broiler on at the end to crisp up the skin. My boyfriend likes mustard much more than me and said it was the best chicken I've made"

"reviewBody": "Similar to Chef John \"Miso Honey Chicken\" recipe, this recipe packs a punch considering how few ingredients there actually are. Rather than 1/2 cup of Yellow Mustard, I opted for 1/4 Yellow and 1/4 \"chinese-style\" hot mustard for slightly extra heat/flavor. Everything else pretty much followed the recipe. Spatchcocking the chicken was a new technique for me. Not hard but definitely requires some more practice. \n\nAll in all, great simple recipe to prepare in anticipation. Prep in the AM and cook in the PM. Chef John did it again! :)"

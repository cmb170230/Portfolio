"reviewBody": "I've followed the recipe but decided to cut the time of cooking by 5 minutes each step (felt that would've been too long for toast) , but unfortunately the toast ended up burning. Still managed to save them by scrapping all the burnt stuff off.\nAside from that, they were really good, but I'd suggest maybe tasting the bread for 15 minutes instead of 30.\nWill definitely try it again though!"

"reviewBody": "This was an easy, quick and enjoyable meal for two. The lemon juice plus vinegar gave it such a bright flavor. The next time I make it I will reduce the amount of vinegar by about a tablespoon. \n\nMy ingredient substitutions were minimal: I used water-packed albacore because I had it on hand and couldn't justify a trip to the grocery store for oil-packed tuna. For the jalapenos I used a generous tablespoon of diced pickled (en escabeche) jalapenos in place of fresh. I omitted the Korean red pepper flakes because we felt the jalapenos would give the dish enough zip. My husband was a little skeptical of how this would taste but he liked it enough to polish off two generous servings of it. I refrigerated the leftover serving and ate it cold the next day. It was still very satisfactory. Thank you Chef John!"

AND, while I was surprised by this, I enjoyed it as much (if not even a bit more) cold than hot or room temp. Oh, it's definitely in the rotation!"

I didn’t have bell pepper or green onions, so I subbed in a small diced carrot and added a little onion powder to the marinade. I also used some leftover brown rice. I almost didn’t add the jalapeño because I was worried it would be too spicy for me, but it was pleasantly spicy even with some sambal oelek on top. It had a nice heat, but it was never overwhelming. I will definitely make this again and try the recipe more “out of the box.” It was comforting, tasty, and filling."

Probably reduce the amount for a bit\n-Tuna in Olive oil (had to use chunks in water and boil off the water and replace it with Olive oil. Not as good as the ones that came in can with plain old vegetable oil as it came out way too \"fishy\" for my taste\n-Jalapeno pepper (fresh not available; substituted with finger peppers or pickled jalapeno)\n-Unwashed long grain rice (tried unwashed; got hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. not a good idea for the quality of rice we produce. we have to wash it. probably need to add cornstarch or rice starch powder but don't know how much)"

While we would have preferred broccoli or box chop, zucchini was what was in the crisper, zucchini it was and it was very good. We thought the seasoning is spot on.Regular basil is fine but Thai basil is so worth it if you can find it! We love Thai inspired flavors but don't have a good Thai restaurant near us, so we look forward to making this recipe again and again. Thinking of shrimp for the next time:)"

"reviewBody": "I should stop listening to other reviews. I was scared it will turn too salty, so I put around 70% of the recommended amount of soy. There was no reason to do it because it wasn't even close being too salty. We even felt we'd enjoy it more if we did put a bit more soy. If you bought a soy sauce with a ridiculous concentration of salt, then obviously the dish will turn salty as well, but that's not the recipe's fault. Check the ingredients of what you're buying. I did put only half of the recommended chicken and it was more than enough. 2.5 pounds of meat for 8oz noodles feels too much for us."

So, I decided to give this one a go. I did the recipe as described and used baby Bok Choy instead of the Chinese Broccoli. Also, the red thai chilis are a bit hot for me so I used Jalapeno along with some sweet red pepper. I also used low sodium Soy Sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out great and was delicious. The addition of the Thai Basil at the end really gives it that Basil kick that is a signature flavor of the dish. I will definitely make this again. Next time I will try a few of the Red Thai chilis because the Jalapeno wasn't quite enough to get the heat to where I wanted it. Other than that, it was great. Thank you Chef John for reminding me about this Thai favorite."

Also, since it’s late October and my herb garden is long gone for the year, I bought “fresh” Thai basil at the Asian market. Nope, I’ll wait until next summer to make this again."

If I have them, I also roast jalapenos! Garnish with cilantro, avocado slices, chopped white onion, chives... elote on the side and dang!"

"reviewBody": "I made these exactly as stated in the recipe, and they were absolutely delicious! I usually make the ones using whole chilis and, although this took as much time and fuss (if one includes making the sauce), it was still worth it, due to the minimal amount of oil needed for frying - so it's healthier. I let the sauce thicken, too. Wow - really, really great recipe!"

My wife who is unfamiliar with Tex/Mex food (and doesn’t like it in restaurants) loved it as did our neighbors with whom we shared it. Thank you Chef John"

"reviewBody": "Made these last night and they were great I had a couple of poblano peppers that I needed to use, but going forward for ease of prep, I will some roasted poblano pepper strips that I get at grocery. Save a lot of prep time. I also used fancy shredded MJ Cheese instead of cubing block cheese.\n\nI made the sauce in my Ninja Hot and Cold Blender using my enchilada sauce recipe adjusted to the spices call for in this recipe.\n\nI think using this process, I can turn this out for regular weekly dinner in about 30 min.\n\nGreat idea to sandwich the peppers and cheese between basically egg omelettes.\n\nHighly recommended."

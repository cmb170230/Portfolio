I set for 350 for 25 minutes convection oven. Perfect. I poked one with dry spaghetti to test for doneness."

So I, after dumping the rolls out, heated the pan again and then scooped the topping out and put it on the rolls. I think I’ll reduce wait time to 1 minute next time. The topping got very tough after cooling. I wish the topping would have cooled to a softer consistency."

"reviewBody": "Nice sticky buns. I haven't baked in a while, and this was a good recipe with which to bake again. The dough is very nice; a little tacky, but easily worked with. I used the bread machine to make the dough as I'm a walk away type of baker. The most difficult part of this recipe for me is that my brown sugar was hard so I had to get it out of the container and soften it in the microwave; otherwise, pretty easy. I didn't oil the pan but didn't need to; the topping, which has butter in it, helped the buns come out easily. I didn't even notice until after I baked this, served this, and we ate it that the recipe called for a 375 degree oven. This is where it's handy to know your oven. Mine always bakes bread and sweets (unless it's pizza or baguettes) on 350, so that's what I set it on. Perfectly done at 45 minutes. This is a good recipe, but the dough is a bit plain for us. I'd maybe add vanilla or cinnamon, but we like a tad more flavor. Most people would like this as is, I think. Thanks for the recipe!"

The sizes weren't as high as John's, so I had to be extra careful to put some foil on the rack below to catch drippings\n\n*I cut back the sugar in the filling to 1/2 cup, which I personally enjoyed more. \n\n* I used a 50/50 split of peacans and walnuts, which was a-okay. They both became deliciously candied in the oven"

I only needed about 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 cups of flour total and the dough was tacky, but maybe not quite as sticky as Chef John's. I live in a dry climate, so that might make a difference. The dough came out nice and soft after baking. The one thing I would change right away is that I would try using only 1 tablespoon of sugar in the dough next time, since it was a tad too sweet for me. I baked mine in a ceramic dish and it turned out just fine. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"

I followed the recipe as closely as I could and I’m pretty sure I didn’t do it as well as it could have been done and the results were phenomenal nonetheless. I may have heated the milk and water a little too much in the beginning of the process and stunted the growth of the used a little bit, if that is a thing. I also did not have a suitable metal pan and used stone bakeware. To top it off I somehow made eight rolls instead of 12 and used no pecans. The finished product did not last long enough for a photo to be taken. The whole family love them. Great recipe chef John!"

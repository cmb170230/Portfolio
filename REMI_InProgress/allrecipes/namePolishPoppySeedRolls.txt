"reviewBody": "Okay so the recipe itself is fine. I made it and they turned out quite well, I agree with those that said to not let the poppy seed mixture get too cold as it will be impossible to spread. However, my biggest gripe with these is that they're essentially tasteless. Maybe I should have added more vanilla or a more flavourful honey? Idk, the end result ended up tasting really bland."

"reviewBody": "Just watch them in the over, 20 minutes turned out to be too long and they got too dark! Also, make sure to make the poppy seed filling just before the dough finishes rising, or else the spread will harden. I had to microwave it for a few seconds beforehand since it cooled too much to spread."

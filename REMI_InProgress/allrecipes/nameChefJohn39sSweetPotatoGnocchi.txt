I thought it would be more difficult to make than it was, so I was happy that it turned out so good, and didn't take me as long as I though. \n\nI always like Chef's John's videos, he is so amusing."

Chef John is a favorite...although I'd love to ask him why it seems he uses cayenne pepper in EVERYTHING.\nThis Sweet Potato Gnocchi in particular turned out great. It was a little complex for an absolute novice like myself but the instructions were clear and the video was really helpful...and entertaining.\nIt was absolutely delicious."

I think it was because I overworked it, either that or too much flour but probably overworked it. I'll try it again for sure, nothing like practice. Flavor was still spot on though."

The gnocchi were soft and pillowy and the sauce was light and flavorful. They do take time (1hr+) and a little bit of work to make but nothing that is out of reach for even basic cooks."

I've never made gnocchi before but Chef John's instructions and recipes are always beginner friendly. The recipe was flexible and I made a half batch! They turned out soft and pillowy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The sauce was okay but thats because I'm not a big fan of bacon. I'll pass on the sauce next time but I'll definitely make this recipe again in the future!"

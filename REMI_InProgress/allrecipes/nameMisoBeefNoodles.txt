"reviewBody": "Made this with a 3.5 lb roast from our favorite Maryland beef company. Pretty much followed the beef part exactly, except I didn’t refrigerate. So I ended up braising the last step a little longer since it took longer to get tender. At the end I used kale instead of bok choy and ttekbokki rice cakes instead of pasta. My family LOVED this. My three children devoured it and asked for seconds. It’s extremely savory and there’s a slight sweetness from the caramelization that balances it out. If you happen to be home for a few hours it’s not hard to just put it in the oven. I will definitely make this again."

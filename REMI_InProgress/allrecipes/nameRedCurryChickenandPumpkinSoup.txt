"reviewBody": "I loved the flavor of this recipe, easily making it vegan by swapping tofu for chicken and vegetable broth for chicken broth. This was the first time I used a kabocha squash, so I watched Chef John's humorous video several times in its preparation. Chef John is absolutely right: The sweet flavor of the kabocha squash is absolutely perfect for this somewhat spicy, Thai-inspired soup. However, nothing prepared me for how difficult it is to cut and peel kabocha squash. Chef John tells us that the skin of this squash species is harder than others. I sharpened my Cutco butcher knife before beginning, yet cutting the squash was still a tricky, time consuming nightmare. I almost asked my husband to help me with his hunting knife so I could field-dress the pumpkin. My peeler was even less successful with the tough exterior of this quarry, causing me to flip back and forth between peeling and cutting -- already a proven challenge. That being said, I don't think the flavor of butternut squash equals what kabocha offers this recipe in particular, in terms of flavor and texture. So, word to the wise, be prepared with a sharp knife, a professional level peeler, and a reservoir of patience when making this delicious soup."

"reviewBody": "I really loved how this turned out. For whatever reason when I went to buy the ingredients for this recipe, I got canned pumpkin and the only thing close to red curry paste was a roasted red pepper chili paste. I used a chicken alternative and veggie broth, but went for the recipe with what I had, I added a chopped zucchini from the fridge for the chunks of pumpkin that I would be missing. So not a total loss, the leftovers are great too!"

Once again Chef John's recipe and video make what looks like a complex recipe easy to follow. I substituted for delicata squash since the kabocha wasn't available at my grocery store, and it was perfect! Adding this to our permanent recipe book."

I could not find the kabocha squash in my neck of the woods, so I used a buttercup squash and it held up in the soup really well. Be very careful with the red curry paste! I used 2 teaspoons of the kind I have and ended up with a runny nose! A good dish for the weekend when you have the time to peel the squash...just sayin’..."

I'm now making them for a second time and am writing this review while the dough is in it's final proof. I'm considering making these ahead of time and freezing them until baking. Sliced up I think they'd make great appetizers. Thanks Chef John! (Again!)"

I added pepperoni and ran out of provolone for my 4th one and used cheddar. Was still delicious. Will make this again often!"

"reviewBody": "I made this substituting sunflower oil for olive oil(happened to be out of olive oil!) And it came out very well. The taste is admittedly different but not bad at all. And I made this with coarse rava (I should have ground it more) and therefore the first one I made just collapsed. But the second and third ones came out perfectly (though it took me about twice the amount of time that Chef John said). And, it smells so much like a pizza. Its my first try, so I forgive myself for the mistakes. Though maybe covering the dough with a bowl may have worked better. It kind of dried out under the towel. And I had to work it for several more minutes to make it smooth. Thank you Chef, I love trying out your recipes."

"reviewBody": "Like some other users I needed to add more water than in the recipe to get the dough to pull together, more like half a cup. Otherwise found this very easy to make. \n\nI'll note that the dough can be rested in the fridge for several days. When I mixed up the dough I did the full batch and after dividing I tossed one of the dough balls into the fridge for three or four days before cooking it. I let it warm up and rise for about 2.5 hours. \n\nThe finished product it outstanding and very unique. I stuck close to the recipe my first attempts with red sauce, cheese and a little arugula. To bake I dusted a peel with semolina and slid scacce directly onto a baking stone in the hot oven, cook 15 minutes and let it cool on a rack for ten. Nice crisp, chewy bread exterior and a lovely saucy pasta-like interior. This will be a fun dish to play around with now that I've got the basic process down!"

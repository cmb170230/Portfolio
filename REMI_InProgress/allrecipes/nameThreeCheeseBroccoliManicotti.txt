"reviewBody": "\"This is a super 5 star recipe\" my husband exclaimed with his first bite! The sauce is light and quite flavorful. I love making Chef John's recipes. They never fail. The only change I made was to substitute basil for parsley. Also garnished with an additional sprinkle of nutmeg, parmesan and basil. We are so excited to have leftovers and left over sauce!!"

I used SWEET BABY RAY'S BUFFALO WING SAUCE, and it still had a kick to it, but it was more like a child kick verses an adult kick lol Thanks for sharing!"

First of all I cooked mine in a 4 qt. crockpot because it’s only me and so I perfectly guestimated how much of everything to add. But what really shocked me is because the recipe called for the \nRanch Dressing mix, it gave the meat taste as if I had put Cheese in the recipe, but I didn’t. And before I ate it I took a picture and sent it to my daughter in California."

It's so easy and oftentimes I'll just make some rice to go along with it and a vegetable and they like it this way just as much as eating as a sandwich. I'm not crazy about buffalo sauce myself, so when shredding it I will just keep some aside for myself before I add back to the sauce. Great, easy recipe!"

"reviewBody": "I absolutely love buffalo chicken wings. I decided to halve this recipe as it’s only two of us. Instead of using our slow cooker, I decided to cook chicken in my Instant Pot for an hour &amp; 15 mins. I used Franks but realized the 2 bottles I had were different labels. Aghast!! One was wing sauce the other Hot sauce. I had already poured the hot sauce when I realized the difference. So note to self for future reference. I then added the equal amount of Wing sauce. I couldn’t wait to try it, it came out so tender &amp; minimal shredding was needed. I found it to be very spicy for my taste &amp; a bit salty but that could have been my fault due to the Hot sauce confusion. I will update when I use the correct sauce in future. Thank you for an easy meal!"

I pull on Hawaiian little rolls with homemade cole slaw and avocado. I forgot to take a photo as we were starving. Next time I will do this with pork shoulder."

I used four chicken breasts, 3/4 of a bottle of sweet baby rays buffalo sauce and a packet of hidden valley ranch dressing mix, low for six hours, then shredded it and returned it to crock pot (with the rest of the bottle of sauce) for an hour on warm. It was amazing! It has quite a kick but cheese and some ranch or mayo helps cut it back a bit. And I normally hate spicy things. Yum!!"

Will make again!"

"reviewBody": "Really easy recipe to follow with just a few ingredients. The only think I added was a 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce and it was somewhat spicy. That was OK since we all like spicy. If you don't like spicy just look for a mild Buffalo Wing Sauce. I cooked it at a low setting for 3.5 hours shredded it and returned it to the crock pot and let it simmer in the juices. I simply shredded the chicken breasts with a knife and fork. A few reviewers commented their chicken breasts were dry but just make sure you cook it on low, and there is enough sauce too. My buffalo chicken did not come out dry at all Another reviewer compared the shredded chicken to tuna. It sounds like they used a processor to shred the chicken. Simply use a knife and fork and it will not shred like tuna! My whole family loves this recipe and asks for it over and over again!"

"reviewBody": "Having made this for many years now, this is one of those failsafe recipes that's easily \"tweakable\" and great for serving a crowd. I always use thighs, as I find they're better suited for the crockpot. A bonus is that my crockpot is a beast and I can have this done from start to finish in 2 hours. I use Frank's Red Hot sauce and serve on toasted onion buns with melted provolone, shredded lettuce, and a side of crispy onion rings. I keep bleu cheese dressing or crumbles on the side for those who want to add extras. Carmelized onions (or even raw for those like me who love raw onions) make excellent toppings as well. This is made often at my house, and will continue on as a game day tradition!"

"reviewBody": "I have found very few of chef John's recipes to be less than fantastic. This is one of those in my humble opinion. The problem is not with the ingredients or the taste of the dish which was delicious. I just think the baking of the roux actually takes more time than just making a roux on the stove top. I have found the stove top roux to turns out much better and quicker."

I made mine in a Dutch oven and finished it on the stovetop. Used canned Simply Seasoned Tomatoes and Okra because I couldn’t find frozen okra at my store. This recipe is a keeper!"

"reviewBody": "I had stopped making Gumbo years ago because of all the time needed to make the roux. When I saw this, I didn’t think it would be the same, but thought I would give it a try. It was amazing, and my family loved it. The only change I made was to cut up the chicken meat and sausages into bite sized pieces before the last session in the oven to make it easier to eat. I also lowered the temp to 375 for the last session, since I thought it was getting a little dark. It was perfect, can’t wait to do it again."

"reviewBody": "Oh my goodness, this was delicious and easy to make. I used the roasting pan that I use at Thanksgiving, which gave me plenty of space for the roux in the middle and the meat around the edges. I had my doubts about the roux method but it worked great. Once you've got the pepper, onion, and celery chopped, there is very little work involve here - just a good amount of time in the oven!"

"reviewBody": "Turned out great and super easy. I broke down a whole chicken and used a mix of chorizo and Hungarian sausage. Took all the chicken off the bones prior to the final cook as it was already falling off. My roux wasn't quite as runny as Chef John's in the video, his flour was likely more aerated pre measuring. Makes a ton, I will be freezing some for sure. Also, I added 4 strips of bacon to compensate for having a mix of white and dark meat."

"reviewBody": "I was a little worried because my roux was getting very brown, as were my sausage pieces (maybe my new oven cooks hot) so by the last two cooking periods, I had lowered the temp to 375 and cut the baking time down by 10 minutes. Even then the sausage pieces were almost black on the bottoms and the roux was 1 shade lighter than black. Much, much darker than what was shown in the video. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I was frustrated that it had gotten so dark and almost didn't serve it, but my daughter said it actually added to the flavor, and my husband came back for seconds. And to be honest, once I tasted it myself I was surprised that it didn't taste burned at all. In fact, the flavor was quite good. So I would say that it turned out well, but next time I would probably start the oven at 375 and not bake it so long for each step."

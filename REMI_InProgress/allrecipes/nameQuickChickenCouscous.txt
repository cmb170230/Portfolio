Definitely adding it to the rotation. It was like a delicious Mediterranean Chipotle bowl. I may add some Greek yogurt next time! Thanks again Chef John!!"

"reviewBody": "I made this using couscous that wasn't whole wheat so that may have changed the ratio of broth to couscous. I used one cup couscous to 1.5 cups broth. Check the cooking instructions on your package. I also made this as a side dish and omitted the chicken but used homemade broth. This was quick, easy and tasty. The turmeric gave it a very nice color. The next day I added leftover game hen and had a nice lunch. Thanks Chef John."

One modification I do is to make the recipe in individual ramekins and it works out great! That way, I can add some cayenne to some ramekins but not the others depending on peoples tastes."

"reviewBody": "Great springboard recipe. I wanted something more luscious and less slimy than a traditional green bean casserole for Thanksgiving, so I made Chef John’s green beans au gratin with changes to bridge the gap. To this recipe, I added:\n\n- 1/2 cup more crème fraîche\n- 2 shallots sliced into 1/4 inch rounds\n- 8 oz. baby Bella mushrooms\n- 6 oz. center cut bacon slices, cut into 1/2 inch pieces\n- Minced garlic\n\nI fried the bacon and then sweated the mushrooms in the leftover fond and grease, breaking them apart into small pieces with a spoon. I then added the shallots, followed by the garlic after the shallots began to turn translucent. I mixed everything together as directed, and baked.\n\nI did substitute gouda for the comté, because I couldn’t find the recommended cheese where I lived and was already using gouda for another recipe anyway. Overall, I highly recommend this. Green beans au gratin was decimated by my family, the majority of whom (I found out after dinner) don’t even -like- green bean casserole. Give this a shot! It may become your new tradition too."

"reviewBody": "DON'T USE \"HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM\"!\n\nMine came out watery, but I think that was my mistake and not the recipes. I thought that \"heavy cream\" and \"heavy whipping cream\" were interchangeable, and heavy whipping cream was the only one available at the store. The cream didn't set, even though I baked until bubbly for 20 minutes and let rest. The only other thing I did differently was use panko breadcrumbs and country-style dijon mustard, but I don't think that would have made the difference. \n\nHowever, the flavor was really nice, the green beans were definitely still the main attraction, and the recipe itself was fairly simple. I'll definitely try it again with the correct ingredients."

I also did not have the cheese but I used feta cheese and instead of the Parmesan cheese I sprinkled some shredded queso cotija ( a Mexican style cheese similar to Parmesan) so I totally improvised and it still turned out delicious. I can’t wait to make it again with all the ingredients called for on this recipe."

So much simpler and tastier than the roux, the bacon, the mushrooms and onions, etc. P.S. we used frozen whole (organic) green beans without chopping in half (gasp!), and it was still perfect. Chef John, you never fail to make me look like a pro. Cheers!"

"reviewBody": "I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fast and simple to make. The green beans tasted fresh and clean without the ever present canned soup in most green bean casserole dishes. The Dijon mustard added a nice sharp flavor without overpowering the fresh taste of the green beans. The only change I made was using crispy fried onions on top instead of bread crumbs. It added nice crunch and contrasted nicely with the tender green beans."

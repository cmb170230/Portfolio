First, the color of the sauce was not the same as the video. Not a big problem; I just added a few drops of Gravy Master to achieve the color I wanted. The biggest disappointment was using LEMON JUICE. The lemon soaked into the mushrooms to the extent it completly overpowered the taste of the mushooms. The recipe definitely has potential and I will make it again WITHOUT the Lemon Juice. The juice completely spoiled the outcome of the recipe."

If youâ€™re a beginner, just read the directions, get your ingredients together and measured, make an assembly line for your flour, panko, etc., and it goes pretty quickly."

The sauce, however, made up for it. Delicious! I will definitely use the sauce recipe again, but with an easier breaded chicken recipe designed for an air fryer."

One seasoned flour and one Panko and Parmesan cheese. I pan fried the breaded chicken first and then made the mushroom sauce in the same pan. The chicken was very flavorful and crunchy. The sauce was okay. I added capers and that really added a lot more flavor."

Learnt some useful techniques e.g., sifting the flour is surprisingly effective &amp; simple for better egg wash adhesion and generally how chicken can be used as a base. Two problems: 2 cups broth is a bit much. I like a thicker sauce, and a whole lot of panko had to be discarded at the end. Finally? Loved it."

I had a lot of extra sauce since the mushrooms werenâ€™t used but Iâ€™m sure I could save it for next time. If I had to change one thing it would be to maybe reduce the chicken broth to one cup and let the Marsala taste shine through. Thanks for sharing!"

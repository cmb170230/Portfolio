We doubled and used red and green bell peppers. I also added some garlic but - I have a hard time not adding fresh garlic to everything. ðŸ˜‰FORGOT the lemon juice! Itâ€™s still sitting on my counter. Oops! But wow oh wow! This was such a wonderful meal, we didnâ€™t notice. I am seriously considering making again tomorrow! Itâ€™s that good!!! Thanks Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "I only had chicken breast on hand. I tucked the thin end under to make the thickness of the breast uniform (no dry bits). I added the whole breast in right before lowering the heat to medium and putting the cover on the pan and didn't touch it for 10mins. When I took the lid off, flipped the breast over to brown for 2mins, took it out of pan to rest while I added the wine and stock. Carved the breast before serving. The chicken was juicy and everything had a beautiful carmelization! Served over orzo. Delicious."

I was concerned about the ketchup overpowering the whole sandwich, however, the sweetness and acidity were very balanced. I will definitely be making this again and experimenting with differently vegetables. Thanks, Chef John!"

The green onions made it and that coming from a girl who rarely cooks with onions at all. One note, I only had a medium thick white bread, I cooked the first sandwich exactly as presented and was a bit soft. So the next one I pre-toasted in the toaster before \"grilling\" in the pan."

As a suggestion chop extra veg as you and everyone else is going to want another. The fried toast didn't stay crunchy for long, next time I will use the toaster and butter it up nicely, maybe let the egg and veg cool down a bit so the steam won't soften the toast so much. Thanks again, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Another one of Chef John's recipes I bookmarked after seeing his YouTube Channel. \n\nFlavor was really great. The egg mixture while cooking in the pan. But, I didn't lose much. It was a bit on the soft side when I took it out of the pan. Going to have to go back and watch his video to see what his looked like.\n\nI used pre-shredded coleslaw and preshredded juliend egg rather than cutting my own, and that seemed to work OK for cutting time.\n\nFor bread I used Texas Toast slices from Safeway. They never really got hard as toast that comes out of a toaster, and I wonder if I either used too much butter, or my pan temp wasn't high enough. \n\nSugar was an intriguing add. Probably used about 1/2 tsp at most, and there really wasn't an overtly sweetness to it all. \n\nI went to cut the assembled sandwich. But, I was afraid it was going to squish out so ate it as is.\n\nOverall it turned out well. I'll definitely make it again once I've went through my process to see what I need to do to improve it."

"reviewBody": "The first time making this will most likely take much more than 15 min prep time. \n Between washing and cutting up cabbage, carrots and green onion and then frying the bread and ham, this took closer to 45 min. We made it for dinner where we plan a bit more prep time. The sandwiches were delicious and huge. Even my 3 teenagers ate only half each and a bit of soup. The first few I forgot the mayo and ketchip but we added it later. We enjoyed it both ways. Overall this was a unique meal we will make again."

"reviewBody": "Well, I say I made it. I basically did (i giggle because I loathe when someone says they made a recipe and when I read what they did, it sounds like they reworked the entire recipe)\nInstead of the carrots and cabbage as in the recipe, I bought a bag of slaw mix with some carrots in it. I mixed the eggs up in a couple of handfuls of the slaw mix and cooked that at the time specified in the recipe. Heated up the ham while I was cooking the egg/slaw mixture. Applied a thin smear of mayo to both bread slices and dotted that with ketchup. Sprinkled a bit of sugar over all that. Put the sammich together from there. Had enough egg/slaw mixture to cook later today. \nAnd as always...\nEnjoy"

The salt is part of what breaks down the carrot and cabbage, and I end up wasting less cayenne and pepper if I add it at the same time as the eggs. There seems to be a lot of variation in what can go into one of these too, if my YT recommendations are anything to go by."

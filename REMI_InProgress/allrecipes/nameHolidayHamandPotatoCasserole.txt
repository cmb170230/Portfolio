I used ham slices from the freezer that my husband had smoked. Next time I will dice the ham and use a little more than called for. Chef John never disappoints, but this dish is really outstanding!"

"reviewBody": "I wanted to try this recipe because I don't make casseroles. This was a fun one to make... it's like a layered lasagna using potatoes and ham, cheese &amp; a delightful white béchamel-type sauce (that's the KEY to this). For the sake of calories, I did use a fat free 1/2 and 1/2. As I mixed in all the goodies, it thickened just fine! I do not use cayenne pepper in anything, so black did just fine. I truly appreciate that Chef John actually provides substitutes in his recipes. I used a white cheese blend that was delish! I made it in the morning, and reheated for serving. It was AWESOME. I believe that sitting in the refrigerator for a few hours allowed all the flavors to do a happy dance. I purposely allowed the top to brown more than some people may like, because my family prefers that toasty type cheese. I did bake it for a little over an hour in convection oven at 325. YUM. You will LOVE this!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was simple and delicious! I used Gruyere as Chef John suggested in his video instead of the sharp white cheddar listed in the recipe. I used an all-natural smoked sliced deli ham but next time I'll definitely use something more substantial that matches better with this amazing sauce. This dish will get eaten first at the potluck, church fellowship breakfast, Easter brunch, office party; wherever you bring it, there will be no leftovers. One last note for people new to Chef John's recipes: If you don't like Cayenne, leave it out...that's just you cookin'!"

I used dried thyme since I didn't have fresh and I also added some dry mustard to the sauce. I used gruyere cheese; next time would use a combo of gruyere and cheddar (flavor is pretty intense with the gruyere alone)."

"reviewBody": "In a word - Perfect. I would say prep took longer - slicing the potatoes and ham. Making the sauce - have to be patient but it does finally thicken up as indicated. Used Fontina cheese rather than cheddar. The ratios are perfect for deliciousness. Served it as a side dish at Easter - and it became The Main Event. People raved about it over and over! Will be making this again for certain. Thanks Chef John - delicious!"

"reviewBody": "This is a very forgiving recipe. I didn't save enough potatoes or sauce for the top layer, and I forgot to salt the center layer of potatoes, yet it came out looking and tasting great anyway. I used a very deep 13X9 dish, which was able to fit the entire recipe. I used a honey maple ham, which added a nice little bit of sweetness in what is a rich and savory dish. I just got it from the deli counter sliced very thin. Don't make the mistake I did, and get a 5lb bag of russets. The bag was mostly small potatoes which added a bunch of extra peeling and slicing. Buy individually and get large russets instead. I don't have a mandoline, and I am not the best at getting even slices, so I added 10 minutes to the cook time to make sure all the potatoes were fully cooked."

"reviewBody": "Made it per the recipe the first time, 2nd time I changed it up a bit. I loosened the skin and seasoned the chicken with kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and chipotle powder, then threw it in the fridge for a few hours uncovered. Seasoned the rice according to the recipe and stuffed the bird. I only used one cup of cooked rice since it’s usually just my husband and I, we don’t need that much rice. I put it on a cast iron iron pan, then flip the bird half way in (just personal preference). We don’t usually have gravy, so I skipped that step. Also I just scoop all the rice out and separate them since I can’t carve a chicken properly and everything just falls out lol. \nBut it tastes soooo good, I love the rice so much! \nMy father-in-law was super impressed with chicken cooked in the oven, he said he’s never had oven roasted chicken that wasn’t dry."

The sauce at the end was flavorful and a great addition to the meat. I cooked it to 165 in the thigh which wasn't enough for the breast and I had to keep sticking it back in the oven. this will be on a regular rotation so I can perfect it. Restaurant quality."

"reviewBody": "Delicious and a lot easier than it sounds to get the layer of rice under the skin. Unfortunately, cooking rice or stuffing around/inside a bird is a bad idea and makes it really hard to gauge cooking times and temp. At 1 hour the skin was nice and crispy, but I was surprised that my instant-read thermometer showed ~100F about an inch into the breast meat. Not trusting my thermometer, I cut into the bird and found plenty of uncooked pink meat about an inch into the breast. Cooked another 10 minutes, then another, then another. Around 90 minutes the breast finally registered 150F and I decided to eat it, but cutting deeper into the chicken I'm a little nervous about it being safely done. The rice and skin are great, as are the wings and drumsticks that cooked normally. Hopefully when I reheat the breast meat tomorrow it will make it completely safe to eat.\n\nedit: upgraded to 5 stars. This is a really simple and delicious way to make chicken and rice. Next time I will insert a thermometer to watch meat temp throughout the cooking time."

Only thing I'm going to change is spatchcocking the bird when I cook it. I also cook mine in a cast iron pan on a pellet grill. Wife says \"you've ruined me from going out to eat at restaurants now\"\nI'll take that as a compliment."

I did think this recipe could use a little salt to offset the sweetness, so I’ll either switch to salted butter and/or add a 1/2 tsp or so of sea salt next time. Definitely a keeper!"

It freezes great and is still moist when pulled out in December. Make sure to wrap it well if you freeze it. I am baking the mini loaves about 25 minutes. This recipe is great to use up those giant zucchini that may be in your garden."

"reviewBody": "I’m sorry to be rude, but I will not use this recipe again. I only used it because I couldn’t find the one I typically use in my cookbook. I would never put cayenne pepper in a sweet quick bread. Also, I had to go back and add 1/2 c of water or so because the batter was too dry from removing the liquid from the zucchini. For meal prepping, esp. when I’m already stressed and pressed for time, this recipe is not ideal. Thank you"

"reviewBody": "I have lots of Zucchini Bread recipes and most are pretty similar. But I love Chef John's style and decided to give his version a try today. Made a few changes and one was inadvertent...I had already beaten 3 eggs when I realized this recipe only called for 2. My oversized zucchini was already very dry, so I didn't salt and rinse it either. I only had 2 cups of Zucchini once grated, and I swapped fresh-picked blueberries for the nuts. I also prefer muffins to loaves, so had to adjust baking time. Other than that, I followed his recipe pretty closely. I liked the unusual addition of ginger and cayenne. The end result was very tasty, and I will be trying it again with the right number of eggs and"

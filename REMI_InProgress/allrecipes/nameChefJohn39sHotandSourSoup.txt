As Chef John suggested, I broiled a boneless pork chop, and sliced it into very thin strips and added it at the very end. OMG, this is the best hot sour soup we have had in years! Our favorite Chinese restaurant had closed awhile back, and we haven’t found anywhere that was as good until now. My husband is out of his mind with glee. Thank you, Chef John, for another amazing recipe!"

I did add a tad more soy sauce &amp; another splash of rice wine vinegar at the end, but it just didn't have that *punch* that we are used to with the soup from our favorite restaurants. Might try finding some black vinegar at an Asian food store and see if that makes the difference. It was good, but not outstanding."

We like it a little thinner, so we added more broth and only one egg, I’d probably do the second egg next time. We like a little heat and added a little thai chili pepper, but otherwise the seasoning was on point, I wouldn’t have added the heat except my boyfriend loves it. Will 100% make again."

ON the one hand, I did not have dried shiitake, so I had to use fresh. BUT, on the other hand, I did have some Zhenjianh, and I also got to add a bit of dark soy sauce to replace a teaspoon of the light soy sauce. The results were sublime. And the heat... my nose was running the whole time, and I loved every bit of it."

I substituted the shitake by regular brown mushrooms and it turned out great as well. It has a little kick due to the white pepper and it just tastes delicious! I’ll be making it more often, that’s for sure. En-joooy!"

"reviewBody": "This recipe was way simpler than I thought possible! Dried shitakes, as suggested, would have given it a more authentic flavor (as far as take-out-hot-and-sour-soup-vibes go), but I used the dried mixed mushrooms I had on hand. The ingredient list included pantry and weekly grocery staples, so it made for an excellent mid-week meal. The soup definitely gets ugly before it turns presentable, but the flavors were harmonious and the texture was smooth without being gloopy. Another win from the tutelage of Chef John!"

We are probably a bit of snobs when it comes to this soup. We added a bit of chili-garlic sauce to help with the zip, but the background flavor was just NOT there. We had hoped that next day leftovers would be more flavorful, but no luck."

Have made it a couple times now and have discovered a few things - if you don’t have chinese black vinegar or *seasoned* rice vinegar, you can used unseasoned rice vinegar with a splash of balsamic vinegar. If you don’t like your soup quite so thick, cut the egg and the cornstarch slurry in half. Also I personally prefer a firmer tofu for the texture instead of the soft. But also delicious as is!"

It turned out as delicious as promised.\n\nI had to make an emergency substation for the carrots (shredded zucchini), but I suspect that affected the colour more than the flavour. After I tried the soup, I added some strips of char siu, since one of our favourite local restaurants serves it that way. The pork complemented it nicely."

It seemed to be fine until I put the egg in--then it kind of dissolved. No matter! it was delicious. Next time, maybe I'll stir in that tofu after the egg and cornstarch. Also, next time I think I'll use a little hot red pepper (have some tiny ones in my freezer). We like it spicy. This was not too spicy for us at all, however, my white pepper was old, so that may have been it."

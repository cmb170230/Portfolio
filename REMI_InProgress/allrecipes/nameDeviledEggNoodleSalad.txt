Followed the recipe exactly and really wouldn't change a thing. At some point I may vary the type of mustard just because I do stuff like that. Loved it. Will make it again. Kept well for lunch the next day."

"reviewBody": "Very good. I ended up using penne instead of egg noodles so I added a few hard boiled eggs that I sliced thinly. Everyone loved it and the eggs were really nice in this. I also mixed in some arugula because I wanted some greens with it. Although this is not a low fat meal because of all the mayo, it was delicious and I will be making it again."

"reviewBody": "Creative twist on the deviled egg. Definitely a fun idea for potlucks. I was pleasantly surprised that this is great by itself for lunch; it was sufficiently flavorful and filling, and you don't have to feel guilty or gross for making a meal out of \"deviled eggs\". Cooking notes: followed the recipe as is, and it was quite tasty with good texture. Boiled pasta for 8 minutes, with generously salted water. Definitely slice the vegetables thinly, so that they provide a crunch without being chunky - we went with 2 in for bite-sized veggies. We used sriracha for the hot sauce and it provides the right amount of punch and flavor."

"reviewBody": "I made this as written but, I did not add the whole amount of hot sauce. Maybe just a few shakes. I have never added 2 teasp. of hot sauce to my deviled eggs! I did slice the celery thin but I chopped the red pepper and I grated the carrot instead of using a vegetable peeler. I didn't have enough egg noodles so I used bow ties. After it was all mixed it just seemed like it needed something else so I added 2 cans of tuna to make it more filling (and give it some protein) and a little dillweed. \nBoth of us liked it and I would probably make it again although it didn't taste much different then other pasta salads I have made."

Although in Sicily we also add a bit of cacao powder to the original dough, so you could add just a bit to this as well to get a darker brown shell, if that’s what you like."

"reviewBody": "I've made this twice now and both times, they came out wonderful! I didn't have Marsala wine (or any wine for that matter) so I substituted 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 1 Tbsp water for the first attempt; then I tried it with 2 Tbsp of milk for the second. They came out the same each time. I would recommend getting 2 baking mats when baking the shells. I had trouble spreading the batter on sheets that just came out of the oven. The batter just wouldn't spread. So use 2 mats, or wait 5-10 mins for the first to cool completely."

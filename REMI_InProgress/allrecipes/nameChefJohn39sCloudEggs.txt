It was a bit tiring wisking them to the right consistency. I might go against Chef John’s recommendation to not use a power mixer next time. (Sorry Chef, I’ll let you know if it’s a disaster). Thanks Chef John, I’m a huge fan of your recipes and helpful videos!"

The only thing was that I baked the eggs a bit too long, so the yokes were not runny. Bake them only for the time suggested. I by accident put it in for extra time. It takes quite a while to whip the egg whites and my arm got quite tired but it other wise was very easy and delicious. I made these for my mom because it was Mother’s Day and she like them a lot too."

The video really helped me with making it, plus he‚Äôs so enjoyable to listen to! Don‚Äôt leave out the goat cheese‚Ä¶ it is the best taste of all with this frittata. Plus the salting of zuccs was the key! I could‚Äôve of drained them a bit better after rinsing, but no complaints! Still amazing! Thank you Chef John for yet another great recipe."

"reviewBody": "Like most of Chef John's creations, this was very tasty and not too difficult. This recipe does require a fair amount of work though. I was in the kitchen prepping, cooking or cleaning something for over an hour.\n\nI had zucchini and Mexican grey squash, so I did make a minor deviation to the recipe. I did cook the squash longer than called for and it also spent more time under the broiler, so your cooking times may vary as well.\n\nIt was very good and I will make this again. The flavor and consistency were both excellent. If the leftovers hold up well I'll probably use this as a cook ahead breakfast for RV trips."

All the little techniques he shows in the youtube video help get that zucci goaty browned eggy deliciousness. This recipe helped me practice temp control too. Chef John is a legend!"

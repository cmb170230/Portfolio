"reviewBody": "I made this and it was extremely good and I made it and it was extremely bitter. The difference? The way I zested the lemons. When I use a fine microplane zester it comes out overly bitter even with short 'steep' times with the sugar and zest. When I use a vegtable peeler, even if I don't do a particularly good job of avoiding the pith or going back over the pieces to remove it after and even with a close to 24 hour 'steep' time, it comes out balanced and delicious. My advice therefor it put down the microplane and use a standard vegtable peeler to make your oleo-saccharum and if you do get a bitter note you don't like add a pinch or two of salt to counteract it."

A week ago we bought fresh squeezed lemonade at a baseball game and my husband was delighted and said it was the best lemonade he had ever drunk. I reviewed the various recipes and decided to use this one. My husband said this lemonade is even better than the one we had at the baseball game. If someone writes that it is too bitter, they either lie or do something wrong. Maybe they used a vegetable peeler that cut off too many of the white parts of the lemon. I have two peelers at home and one is cutting thinly (y-peeler) and the other is cutting more thickly (classic euro)."

"reviewBody": "The fragrance of the oleo-saccharum was amazing. I followed the recipe to the letter. Individual tastes vary, however. I found the finished product a little too sweet, and with a bit of \"off taste\" from the intense oil from the peels (I used organic lemons, scrubbed under hot water prior to removing the peels, no pith, let them sit in the sugar for almost 12 hours). I corrected by juicing an additional lemon, adding about a half cup more water, and as another poster suggested, a teaspoon of vanilla. Fantastic!!!! The pitcher was consumed pretty quickly by myself and two friends. Next time (because there WILL BE a next time) I will cut the sugar to 1 cup, let the peels sit for less time, and add a touch of vanilla. A wonderful recipe! Many thanks, Chef John! ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó"

"reviewBody": "For those who say it was bitter, perhaps you had too much pith, the white part under the peel, in your mixture. The pith is very bitter. When the lemons are peeled with a vegetable peeler, only the thin outer yellow part of the peel comes off, and not the bitter pith. The peel contains the oils that give this lemonade its deep lemon flavor. This is why some cake and cookie recipes call for a teaspoon or so of grated lemon or orange peel. What I love about this lemonade is the bright, lemony flavor. So very lemony, yet not sour. Almost like drinkable lemon drop candy."

This time I've done a triple batch with 18 lemons and 15 cups of water. I used my centrifugal juicer to handle the lemons this time, but strained the extra pulp out. The juicer produces a lot more juice and it's cloudier because it's extracting a lot more. Will be interesting to see how this turns out."

If you want to avoid that taste, add an extra quarter cup of sugar to the recipe and scoop the peels out with a slotted spoon quickly after you add the the sugar and lemon peel mixture to the boiling water. The lemonade will be sweeter with a lot less of a bitter taste. Enjoy!"

You get some of the bitterness of the peel, which I like, but if you don't just add a bit more sugar and it will balance out the bitterness well. The flavor is much more complex than a typical lemonade or limeade, which is great! Definitely should be drank with ice.

"reviewBody": "The first time I made this recipe, it was very bitter, but I made it a second time and figured out what went wrong. I added too much lemon juice! The oleo-saccharum tastes like liquid hard candy when you strain out the peels. It's light, sweet, and citrusy. The second time I tried this recipe, I squeezed all my lemons and added the juice in a quarter cup at a time. I think I had about two lemons' worth of juice left before I struck that right balance between sweet and tart. So my advice for anyone who had bad results is to limit the amount of juice you use and to taste it a little bit at a time before you put it in the fridge to chill. Also, don't worry too much if your zest has pith (white stuff) on the under side. The fresh-squeezed lemon juice is really what has the potential to make your lemonade tart. Next time I make it, I'll add a bit of mint or maybe Chef John's strawberry syrup..."

Both choices were terrible. The lemonade was nice and floral, but it was also bitter because I left in too much of the white pith, or maybe because meyer lemon oil is just bitter.\n\nPlease just use regular lemons. Don't be extra like me. Regular lemons have a thicker peel and don't taste like perfume."

That oleo saccharum in tandem with the fresh fruit flavor really makes for a heck of a summer beverage.\n\nI've since made a double batch, which was also amazing, and tried it with limes as well. You just can't go wrong with this recipe.\n\nProtip: be careful to not get much of the pith into the bowl when skinning the fruit. If you do and find the results to be bitter, let it sit in the fridge for a day or two; this will mellow out these notes significantly.\n\nFinally, Chef John, you've inspired a recipe of my own. I call it Italian Lemonade."

I think people mess up where they don't let the oleo saccharum (lemon peels &amp; sugar mixture) marinate for 12 hours. \n\nThey also might mess up when they toss oleo saccharum into the boiling water. You should turn off the heat when the water boils. Then toss the peel sugar mixture. Quickly stir and strain immediately. \n\nGood luck on making this refreshing lemonade! :D"

Since I've never had any lemonade that tasted as good, I chalked it up to me young at the time, and glorifying my dad's recipe.\n\nWhen I tasted this recipe, I realized I was wrong. This is it! The taste that had eluded me for decades is found in this method. \n\nSo much flavor! Just make sure not to get too much of the white part with the peel, as this is where the bitterness comes in.\n\nI've made two batches thus far, and the taste is consistent. I doubled the last batch to share with family and friends.....same taste.\n\nLove it, and thank you Chef John for this small taste of home. I'm a fan!"

"reviewBody": "Where I live non-carbonated lemonade is not a thing. So this was a first. And it was a delicious one although I cut back the sugar by half and used a little less lemon juice. The lemon oil sugar is perfect and was not bitter at all. I used untreated and unwaxed lemons and gave them a good scrub before peeling. \n\nI will make another version with less water and dilute it with sparkling water to make what I know as lemonade. I also think this would be great mixer with beer for hot summer nights. \n\nI think this will great with limes or oranges too!\n\nEdit: I made it with limes three times now and I prefer it to the lemon version. I put the hot water on top the sugar-zest-mixture and let it cool like that. It becomes a little more bitter and the end product taste a little like a bitter lemon. I use 8 untreated limes (gives about 150ml of juice), 100g of sugar and add enough hot water to get to 1 liter of lime-onade. To serve it I use 1 part lime-onade and 4 parts sparkling water."

I only let the sugar and peel mixture sit for about an hour and a half because I was afraid of the reviews saying theirs were too bitter. I added about 7 cups of water since I had 2 more lemons than the recipe called for. The lemon flavor is so strong and delicious. I want to make HUGE batches just to sip on and I think I'll even try to make diet lemonade using Stevia! Thank you Chef John! I look forward to your next Youtube video."

This recipe took me a whole day to make(i left the peel in sugar for a full 12 hours) but it was definitely worth it. My grandma who dislikes Lemonade actually enjoyed it. I will say that in my opinion it may actually be a bit too sweet so next time im going to cut out 1/4 cup of the sugar. I also think this recipe would be perfect to experiment with adding bitters for a little extra complexity."

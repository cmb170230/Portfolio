The mixture was a complete liquid after adding the chocolate and butter, so I added a bunch more flour and some more cocoa powder. I thought it was good so I put it in the oven for 30 minutes when the toothpick came out clean, but the brownies ended up tasting like chocolate cake. Not crispy on the outside, not fudgy in the inside. Just cake. Overall, these aren't \"The Best Brownies\"."

(Take it from two chefs ;}) 1) I add some espresso to heighten the chocolate flavor. 2) Use salted butter (sometimes browned with the pecans), less in recipe, sprinkle fleur de sel atop 3) hand beat in flour I'm afraid, vewy afwaid to beat the flour. 4) I butter and either sugar or cocoa \"flour\" for ease of release. 5) Pecans... butter and salt toasted The rest is great!"

I have read a couple reviews that these were too sweet, but I was originally worried the cacao would be overbearing for my elementary schooler. In reality, the awesome tones of the cacao are in there, along with chewy goodness and sweetness - this is a good recipe. I'm holding out on five stars because my review is coming a few weeks after attempt #1, and I'm not ready to commit my old man brains to a five star yet. I'll update my rating when I realize the error of my ways.\n\nAnd for those wondering, review based on following recipe as is. Today I'm doing something doomed for failure with coffee, and hopefully chef John's base recipe will save my experiments from total catastrophe"

Ever since Lady Lee brownies disappeared from Lucky's Supermarket, I've been unhappy with all brownies. \n\nI don't know why it didn't occur to me before to try Chef John's recipe. I love almost everything I try of his.\n\nWell, he didn't disappoint. They aren't Lady Lee, but they are as close as I've been so far. We loved them. They were crisp on the outside, chewy on the edges, and gooey on the inside. We loved them. \n\nThanks, Chef John."

I was afraid of the excess sugar and forgot to use less, or add more cocoa powder to offset the extra sugar and fat in the bars. They still came out like Chef John said they would- crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I doubled the recipe and needed an hour plus of baking time using a big toaster oven. I used a deeper 8x13 glass dish. There weren't any excess sugar crystals. Whipping the batter to get the air inside made the difference. I would try it with some mint chocolate and nuts in them next time and offset some of the sugar."

"reviewBody": "I’m so sorry Chef John, but these brownies are not good! The texture is exactly as he describes, chewy edges, soft center, but they taste entirely of sugar. There’s also not a lot of chocolate flavor, which is really disappointing. The after taste is the worst part — It makes me feel like I just downed a tablespoon of pure sugar. He suggests a glass of milk, which I think would help a lot, but I also think they should be edible on their own! I’ve tried to give them to 2 different people and they both say they’re just too sweet. I’d be curious to see how these come out with half the sugar and way more chocolate, so maybe give that a go if you try this recipe out.\n\nI love Chef John’s videos, though! And I can’t deny that they look really pretty when they’re plated up."

It still fit in the square glass Pyrex dish.\nSecond: I put the bar of chocolate box and all into a quart freezer bag and smashed with a hammer on the concrete patio. This is way easier than cutting with a knife."

I couldn't have access to a unsweetened 100% cacao chocolate but my 85% bar worked amazing, if you don't want to do math to get it right and subtracting the last 1/4 cup of sugar or even less would do the trick. I totally sold with this recipe, great flavour, great texture and super easy to make. If you haven't found a brownie that meets your expectations give this one a try."

I didn’t have that experience just the opposite. I thought that they were just the right sweetness and I even made a mistake in such a hurry to make the recipe that I forgot vanilla ingredient! To no avail the brownies still were delicious. One change that I would make next time is to actually use high-quality non-sweetened chocolate. I only had dry cocoa to use it still turned out just fine. I will make again."

I usually absolutely love every recipe Chef John has shared with us (and I have cooked tons of his dishes), but these were insanely too sweet in my opinion (and I love sugar sadly) and we kept biting into undissolved salt crystals which was a total turn off. (He said to use kosher salt and most of the crystals didn’t dissolve.) I will never make this recipe again and am still on the hunt for the perfect brownie recipe that has nuts! I think nuts helps cut the sweetness in general."

"reviewBody": "These brownies turned out delicious and the perfect texture! I've been planning to make brownies for a few days now so was excited to see that Chef John posted a recipe! I wouldn't normally do all the steps suggested in a recipe or use as many bowls, but I did in this case and I am glad I did, plus our home now smells amazing as a side bonus. I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1 1/4 cup, and used a stand mixer instead of handheld - kept everything else the same.\n\nMy husband and I follow a lot of your recipes and have loved every single one so far! Thank you!"

"reviewBody": "They're delicious, but I did find that for some reason the cook time needed about twice as long as the recipe expressed. I was still dipping the knife into raw batter well into 55 minutes of baking. The only alteration I made was adding a small scoop of mini chocolate chips, nothing that should have made the time difference that large."

"reviewBody": "This took us a long time to put together - but it came out great. A couple of observations:\n1. We were nervous that the dough would not stretch far enough, and while it did, I think the crust is thinner than Chef John's video. Still really good.\n2. The larger pepperoni worked great. We also added some Italian sausage crumbles.\n3. The pizza sauce is so good! \n4. We don't have a gas stove, but we heated up the whole pizza on the grill for a couple of minutes. Worked perfectly.\n\nLeftovers freeze/reheat well. Definitely a keeper, albeit quite a project!!"

"reviewBody": "As a kind of pizza, the end result is restaurant quality. The sauce is very good, but not WNY style.The Detroit style dough makes a tough, thick layer similar to focaccia and not at all like Buffalo pizza.\n\nOverall, this is a good pizza, but needs a different name. It just isn’t Buffalo style pizza. Even when Chef John misses, he still makes great food.\n\nPlease, Chef John, try Buffalo style pizza for yourself so we can get a more accurate representation from you. You’re a master at recipes!"

I only needed to cook mine 15 mins in the oven, but maybe bc I used less cheese (I thought I had mozzarella, but had to improvise with Monterey Jack and parm). Thanks for sharing!"

"reviewBody": "So, I’ve lived in Buffalo my whole life and LOVE the pizza here. This looks great but 2 things: 1)I’ve never seen sauce spread all the way to the edges here and 2)That crust is way thicker than any Buffalo-style pizza I have ever had. That said, this still looks delicious! I know I am too lazy to ever make this though bc all I have to do is make a phone call and I will have an amazing pizza delivered to my front door in about a half hour"

"reviewBody": "Great recipe. I used the Detroit dough recipe and let is rest in the mixing bowl for an hour. It came out great. The only thing I need to figure out is the cheese seemed to over cook before the rest of the pizza was done. I'm not sure if I should change the type of cheese or lower the temp and keep it in longer. Either way, it was great. Kid approved!"

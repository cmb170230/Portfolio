My husband was expecting more spice from the habanero and was surprised by the sweetness of the sauce so I think next time I'll include the seeds and cut the sugar a little in the marinade. We used tater tots just because the grocery stores have been sold out of fries lately. Still a success and we will make it again."

"reviewBody": "Really good recipe! We love spicy food so changed the 1 habanero to 5. My hands and lips are still burning. The other thang I did was cook the fries in the oven and add them just before. For my husband, he doesn’t like food touching so they were on the side but mine were mixed. We had plenty of sauce and now lots of leftovers! Next time I would use normal fries and cut the spring onions a bit longer. Fantastic recipe, I highly recommend it."

The only change I’d make is that next time I’ll cook the fries in the air-fryer as the rest of the stuff is cooking. I wasn’t a fan of doing them in the skillet. We will make this again!"

"reviewBody": "We liked this. The flavor was very good. I couldn’t find a habanero so I subbed a jalapeño. It worked. I really loved the ease of this. I saw a review saying the mix was dry; make sure to dump all the steak and pan drippings into a bowl prior to frying the veggies. Then dump all of it back into skillet at the end. The tomato should also give some nice liquid. I used a wok and kept it on high heat. It cooked up fast."

"reviewBody": "Super delicious. The hardest part was prepping. I could not find Sirloin steak at my grocery so had to use a difference type of beef that was sliced thinly and it worked amazingly well. Also only used orange peppers as I could not find the aji amarillo or habanero peppers. It still worked out well. Outside of prepping, the cooking time itself was real fast. So this is the type of meal I like to prepare - quick and delicious."

"reviewBody": "This is not how my Peruvian husband makes the dish, but I trust Chef John enough to know that it's probably just as good (if not better - sorry, amorcito!). I had to laugh when I saw the little carefully molded mound of rice - very Peruvian! And the carb on carb comment - spot on. After 10 years together I have gotten mi amor to just eat this dish with French fries. On the side, BTW. Finally, you can find aji amarillo in a paste at international markets, so do try, the flavor is wonderfully unique. Gracias, Chef Juanito!"

I highly recommend using the largest pan you have (there's quite a lot of stuff to mix together in the end) and be sure it is non-stick so the fries don't get stuck on the bottom. But the recipe is excellent as is! Sweet, spicy, salty . . . and tasty. Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Serving in Latin America, this is a very well known cultural dish of Peru. It is one of the best ones that I know of! Usually when I ate it, the fries were either mixed or under the meat mix and never to the side. Usually you can find yellow peppers at any Spanish Market, but if you can't find those there is a paste that you can buy too that works really well. For the fries, I personally wouldn't use the crinkle cut because of how thick they are. How I usually ate it was with some normal fries. But it's all to taste and what you have. You always have to include the rice too. That is a must.\nAnyways, well done Chef John for another great recipe! A personal favorite for me!"

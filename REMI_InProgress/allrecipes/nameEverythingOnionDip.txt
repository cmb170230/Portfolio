I caramelized the onions on low for about 30 mins. because I had the time. I also subbed the sour cream with Greek yogurt. What a difference it makes by letting the flavors chill together overnight. This dip tastes great with bell peppers as a vessel or some kettle potato chips. Thanks for this yummy recipe."

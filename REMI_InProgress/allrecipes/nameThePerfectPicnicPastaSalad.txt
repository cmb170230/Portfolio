I followed the recipe exactly (except that store did not have flat parsley so I had to settle for curly). I also wanted tri-color pasta but the store was not interested in what I wanted today. I would not change a thing. This recipe is a keeper that is going into my recipe box for future use."

The recipe is great as-is and we added lemon zest and fresh parm to it just before serving and really liked that addition as well. It is on the menu tomorrow for an Independence Day cookout! Give this one a try!"

"reviewBody": "I made this pretty much exactly as per the published recipe, and it was fantastic. My variations were to used shallot &amp; garlic seasoned oil for the dressing, and a little bit of garlic powder too, and Korean pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Overall however it was basically the same and it is probably the best pasta salad I've ever had. Fresh peas are a tad undercooked with just a couple minutes of boiling, but that made it better."

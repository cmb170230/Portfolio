Once, a shredded rotisserie chicken and once chicken breasts I simmered and shredded. It is a little spicy for me, but not for everyone else in the house, but I have a hard time with the spiciness of Rotel tomatoes lol. It is spicy but delicious and it doesn't stop me from eating it! Very easy and very yummy! I've added it to my dinner rotation, and every one is happy when they see turkey or chicken chili mac on the menu!"

(BEST TURKEY RECIPE EVER!) with bacon stuffing, no beans, no cocoa, no cinnamon, double the amount of mac noodles, and double cheese to make a food so good we are adding it to the list for turkey leftovers! We made it last night and only two bowls survived the night to find out it is great for breakfast too!\nHope you have/had a wonderful Thanksgiving!\nChris &amp; Carla"

"reviewBody": "This is now the go-to recipe. Our turkey was 16 pounds and I'd say we could have gone a little less than 2 hours on this. The only thing I might do differently next time is a foil wrap around the drumsticks. Those shrunk back quite a bit and were a little dry. The breast meat was juicy and delicious. I was nervous to use that much salt, but I shouldn't have been. Thanks for a great recipe. Now the oven doesn't have to be tied up for the whole day. This will be a game changer for planning the Thanksgiving Day meal!"

"reviewBody": "Absolute perfection! I made this on Thanksgiving day so I did not have a store open to buy the bread. No worries - I had a roaster pan with a rack. I was a bit worried about the high heat (my oven kept initiating the cooling fan process) but it came out juicy and tender. I left it upside down and the back skin was crisp and delicious. Everyone loved it. I'll never make turkey any other way again!"

"reviewBody": "Incredible on so many levels. Worked perfectly, in fact a 17 lb was done sooner but we didn't have a thermometer. Didn't try the bread, just used a rack so maybe that contributed to faster cook - will try the bread another time just because it sounds delicious. Almost everyone then asked for the link to this page, all blown away at how efficient and good it was. \n\nThose of us who prefer dark even loved the white because of how incredibly juicy it was. Do season as suggested - don't skimp."

"reviewBody": "I wouldn't bother flipping it over. The skin on the back was no longer crispy after flipping and the breast skin did not have enough time to get good and crispy. We saved the bread and made simple bread dressing with it a few days later. The extra butter and turkey drippings made a divine dressing. The browned bread bits softened up during cooking and made it extra rich."

"reviewBody": "This was so easy and fast and juicy! I used a baguette under the 17lb turkey, one half under the breast bone and other halves on either side of that. They were completely flattened by the turkey but I added them to my stuffing and they were fantastic. \n\nWill definitely make again. Possibly for slightly less time by just 5 to 10 minutes."

Unfortunately, my bread got a little too squishy and tough in spots to eat, but it kept the breasts moist and cushioned perfectly. I also used the make ahead gravy which was perfect a well! Will use the recipe again next Thanksgiving"

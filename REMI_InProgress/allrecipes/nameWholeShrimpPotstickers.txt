Transfer to a work surface and knead until dough is very soft but not super sticky. Knead, roll, and stretch dough until smooth and fairly elastic, about 3 more minutes. Wrap dough with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for about 1 hour."

Use a rolling pin to roll it into a 3 1/2-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick. Dip your finger into some cold, fresh water and moisten the edge of the circle. Spoon 1 shrimp into the center, along with a little bit of green onion and marinade. Fold dough around the shrimp and press edges together until perfectly sealed. Trim any excess dough from the ends and either discard or reuse. Crimp the edges a bit with your fingers, if desired. Transfer to a flour-dusted plate and refrigerate while you assemble the remaining potstickers."

Cook for 1 minute, then add 2 teaspoons butter to the pan. Tilt the pan as the butter melts to distribute it evenly and cook until the bottoms of the potstickers are golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and quickly cover with the lid. Steam dumplings until cooked through and most of the water has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and repeat to cook the remaining 6 potstickers with remaining oil and butter."

"reviewBody": "This was a mixed bag for me. I am not the greatest when it comes to executing dough. I think mine was too thick. I found the whole shrimp inside hard to eat and prefer potstickers with a minced mixture inside. But the marinade and the sauce are terrific! When I saw the dumplings not going so well, I took the rest of my marinaded shrimp and stir fried them then mixed them into some rice. It’s delicious! The dumplings didn’t taste bad even in spite of my stodgy dough. They were nothing to look at, but it wasn’t a total flop. I probably would have been better off to use packaged won ton wrappers. I may try that next time and also throw my marinaded shrimp into the food processor before filling."

"reviewBody": "I followed the recipe as prescribed but was not 5 star happy with the results. I did my best with dough thickness when rolling, but it still was too doughy after cooking. The overall flavor wasn't strong, very mild at best. The shrimp coating was good if you want to just pan fry the shrimp."

I made this and while the flavor is good I started the recipe at the top and completed the potstickers and to my surprise after cooking, I reread the recipe and tips to find the dough is for 36 shrimp. Had I known I would have cut the dough recipe in thirds. This is a recipe for 12 shrimp in every way except in the tips at the very bottom does it say the dough is for 36. No where in the u tube does it say that either. Next time I will be cutting the dough recipe."

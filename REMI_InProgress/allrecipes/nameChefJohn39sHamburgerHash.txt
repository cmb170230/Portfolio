I followed the recipe for the most part. I used all butter instead of olive oil since I was out. In lieu of mushrooms and bell pepper, I used green chiles as that is what I had. I didn't get the crustiness because I used a cast iron and all my crusty's stuck to the pan :(. But it was still a winner and I added shredded cheese on mine and it was great!"

I have been making hash for years, but did not know about pressing down the food to increase browning, trick (in the video). You can teach an old dog new tricks!"

"reviewBody": "I really like Chief John's recipes and I usually follow his recipes to a ' T'. However,my mother was an expert in making Hash,so instead of cooking the hamburger, and then throwing in the potatoes all together,I use my mother's procedure, and fry the diced potatoes first and cook until they are crispy,rather then soft. After they are crisp remove them to another plate,keeping them warm,and proceed cooking the hamburger,onions,peppers,mushrooms,and seasoning as written,with the only exception of frying the potatoes first then adding them to the other ingredients once they have cooked thoroughly. By doing it this way,I get that same texture of my mother's homemade hash with the crispiness coming from the potatoes, and Chief John's professional technique. The best of both world's so yummy!"

"reviewBody": "What a fun and tasty spin on Bruschetta!! I would absolutely make again! My husband devoured and I it! I also think you could sub fresh Basil for the chives if that’s what you had on hand. My only minor complaint; smashing the garlic clove and then adding the olive oil; I get it! It’s to infuse the oil but the clove pieces fall off the bread when grilling. The few bits that cling to the bread were delicious! Also - I did on a gas grill for quick results- especially since I only fired it up for this recipe/this step. I have never grilled French bread like this so that new idea alone I will copy again for other meals! Thanks again for the tasty side dish or appetizer!!"

"reviewBody": "A long time ago I worked for a non-Kosher Jewish deli called Munch-a-Bagel (I was the fry cook). Best bagels and bialys ever in my life! Marge &amp; Leon Rich--fed everyone with love. I like Chef John and we make a lot of his food. It never disappoints! Taste--comparatively to Leon's-- was excellent. The texture perfect. Mine look too popped up. Next time I will make the dough much flatter before putting it in the oven so they will be more like a NY bialy. It could be my oven or an altitude thing. If I may mention... the perogies. We boiled and then fried them. You could use those tasty treats as weapons--people will do anything to eat those! Thank you Chef John, love you!"

"reviewBody": "Tried this twice just to make sure I didn't mess anything up measuring the first time. 1 and a half cups of water isn't enough to hydrate the flour mixture and make a sticky dough. My guess is the author didn't measure and guessed how much he used after. Unless you're an expert in dough making that can eyeball the amount of water you need I'd recommend not wasting your time and ingredients."

This was super simple recipe but delicious outcomes. As chef John says on YouTube, really only need a teaspoon of the onion, I didn’t heed his advice and had some blowouts. Also would suggest really trying to make a large opening in center and flattening them out as they will rise. They were delicious after resting out of the oven and warm and were awesome the next day in a egg sandwich. Also be sure to brush with water evenly to get crispness and less flour chalky patches."

Also followed Chef John's suggestions for thickening the sauce. This was just fantastic. Served it with white rice and it was just perfect. All the warmth from such a deliciously cozy meal for a very cold day of winter! Will make it again."

I made it as written but popped the chicken under the broiler before serving. The chicken was so tender and flavorful and the sauce was delicious on top of Chef John's mashed potatoes. The chicken base really delivers on amping up the flavor and the dried currents and saffron make for an interesting color / taste. Happy to have this recipe in the rotation. Thanks, Chef John."

"reviewBody": "I just made this and it was delicious and pretty easy to make which means it will be added to my rotation of quick and easy weekday meals. One change I made was using garlic powder instead of fresh garlic since dried herbs/spices seem to work better with long braising times. All the other spices I kept the same (including Saffron!). I also added a can of drained chickpeas during the last 30 minutes of cooking and they soaked up a lot of flavor and helped thicken the sauce. I love the texture they added to the final dish. Served it with wild rice cooked in chicken stock and steamed broccoletti . Thank you, Chef John!"

Let the sauce simmer down to a thicker consistency. Sorry Chef John, couldn't justify the Saffron, - used a little more turmeric instead. Still very tasty!"

Pic shows a knife but you don't even need it. A few changes I made: Couldn't find currants so I used 1/4 cup roughly-chopped raisins instead (felt like 1 tsp was a weirdly small amount?). Also didn't want to pony up for the saffron so I used an additional 1/2 tsp turmeric. I would definitely make this again! Further proof chef John is a culinary God"

"reviewBody": "It was absolutely great! Turned out exactly as presented. It’s pretty rich given the 8 oz of dark chocolate so you definitely need the unsweetened whip topping to cut the richness a bit. Definitely serve in at least six serving cups if not 7 or 8. A little goes a long way. Also don’t skip turning the sauce out into a sieve. That’s what ensures it comes out smooth as silk. Trying to think now how to make it for my husband who loves pudding but not rich chocolate… more pudding sauce and less chocolate maybe? Different chocolate altogether? Both? Will figure it out. Thanks Chef John! This was a hit and easy and fun to make."

"reviewBody": "Made this after watching the video. The video shows a quick and easy way to separate eggs, but be careful if your eggs are at room temperature as the yolks tend to break apart easier than if chilled. I didn't have dark chocolate chips so substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips. I ended up with about 3 cups of puddino, so filled each of six glasses with about 1/2 cup. All was fairly easy *except* tilting to coat the side of the glass an extra 1/2\" -- definitely not as easy for me as it was for Chef John! My filling was too warm and thin, so the coating on the glasses looked kind of like I was just sloppy while I was filling them and the level wasn't even on all sides. I re-tilted after the glasses had been in the refrigerator about 10 minutes and the puddino had a chance to thicken up a little and they looked much better, but the level still wasn't even. Because of that, I decided to whip my topping. I topped all with miniature chocolate chips. Taking Chef John's suggestion, I made meringue cookies and folded one cup of Andes Mint chips into the batter and served those on the side. Delicious and everyone loved it! These would make great dessert \"shooters\" if prepared in shot glasses. Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John."

"reviewBody": "Delicious rich and thick chocolatey dessert. I used bittersweet Ghirardelli morals, which are in the 60% range. Be careful when heating the egg mixture. Just a few seconds too long and you could end up with scamebbled eggs (I almost did this). This is very rich so dividing it in 6 portion is just enough for one person. Don't forget the whipped cream either. It adds just the right amount of airy cream to offset the dense chocolate. I made this for Valentine's Day, but it's an easy recipe for any special event or chocolate craving."

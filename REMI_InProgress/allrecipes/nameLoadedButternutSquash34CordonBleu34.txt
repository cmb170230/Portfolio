I also did a smaller butternut with Saitan (a bit of liquid smoke, worcestershire, and brown sugar to mimic the smoked ham flavor) and that was GONE too. Yet another triumph for Chef John."

"reviewBody": "My family loved this recipe. My wife was talking about how good dinner was over a hour after we ate. I wasn’t too sure how my 8 year old was gonna like it. But she thought it was very good and described it as if McDonald’s was to do Mac &amp; cheese this is what it would taste like. It was a strange way to give a complement, but I’ll take it. I will add this to a fall rotation of meals for sure. Since the roasting takes most of the time I roasted it the night before. Also the night before prepped the ham and cheese mixture. Wrapped the squash on the fry and in the fridge overnight. Next day scooped and mixed with egg and Dijon. Made it a quick meal. Thanks again, Chef John."

I added 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning too. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese along with remaining Swiss on the top prior to final baking. We loved it! Will make again!"

I'm making it for the 3rd time today. The only change I made was to use baby Swiss, as that I what I use in my Chicken Cordon Blue, plus its cheaper than Gruyere. I love Chef John's recipes, as well as his personality. As always, thanks Chef John!"

So so good, the mustard makes it. Will make again with different combos. I'm thinking garam masala would be a great addition, and of course cayenne.\nYet another Chef John recipe that tastes as good as it sounds!"

I used frozen pre-cut squash (from Costco), followed the microwave instructions for that. Mashed up the squash from there, seasoned it, and added the ham, cheese, egg, mustard. Topped with extra cheese and baked for about 20 min at 475. Came out great too! I just wanted a way that was a little quicker for week nights. Will for sure make it again both ways."

I only used 6 oz of gruyere because that was the package size and it was plenty. Next time, I would like to try it with mushrooms for a holiday side dish. \n\nFor those on WW (weight watchers), it was 9 pts (blue plan). If you use less cheese or a low fat white cheddar, you can reduce the points."

Made it exactly as written, except I shaved the cheese for the topping instead of grating it (as Chef John does in the video): quicker, easier, less mess, and same end result.\n\nTip: personal preferences and ham saltiness vary widely so consider both when you're adding salt to the squash. I think the squash mixture still needs *some* salt, but you may want to scale back."

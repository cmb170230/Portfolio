I went back and checked how much butter I used, and it was accurate, as I had taken a fresh stick from a new box, so I could easily double check. The oils from the nuts probably added to it. I wrapped them in paper towels to see if it'll help, but no luck. Maybe just not my taste. Oh well."

"reviewBody": "These were VERY good. I used a small cookie scoop and I probably should have made them even smaller. They were a bit smaller than a saucer. I also should have chopped the nuts more but was concerned they would process to a powder. So I will watch that next time. (there will be a next time) My family all said next time I should make them with Macadamia Nuts. I also think a slight sprinkle of flaked salt will take the edge off the sweetness. Or use a Bittersweet Chocolate or even unsweetened rather than semi sweet."

"reviewBody": "Very disappointing. The cookies taste good, but they run all over the pan and make a sheet of cookie, instead of round cookies. I tried baking a sheet with fewer cookies (5), using very little cookie mixture, but they still all ran together. If using honey, don't bake nearly as long as the recipe recommends. The \"cookie\" tastes good, but it's more of a crumble than a cookie because you have to break it up into pieces, since it all ran together in a sheet."

"reviewBody": "Really easy to make and oh so yummy! I used sliced almonds that I had and toasted them first. A note is to measure out all of the batter into portions of the size you want (I made them each .5 oz) as when it cools as batches are cooking, it becomes like caramel and is hard to measure. I suppose that is because it is caramel! I love Chef John's recipes and always look for his new ideas."

"reviewBody": "This was a really nice gift for friends and neighbours. Not sure I would have made them without a silpat pad- very sticky. They look very big but I used the regular cookie scoop so there is not a lot of dough in each one. They darkened while they were cooling, so don't worry if they don't look very dark when you take them out of the oven. They are so fragile I worried that they would break when I applied the chocolate but they held up fine."

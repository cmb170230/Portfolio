"reviewBody": "Husband loved how tender this cheaper cut of beef was. I cut it against the grain to 1/2 “ cubes. I added 1 lb. Button mushrooms to browned meat and used 1/4 cup left over jar spaghetti sauce instead opening a can of tomato paste. It was delicious and I will make this again soon. Served it with egg noodles or mashed potatoes- no tots."

"reviewBody": "This got rave reviews from my family, and it is very easy to make. The process worked out just as Chef John's video showed it. I do recommend using a pan more than a pot, and have a tight-fitting lid for the time it spends simmering. It is easier to flip the meat with tongs for the browning step when it is in a pan rather than a pot. The sauce is luscious and smells fantastic."

It was delicious and actually a good detour from the typical mashed potatoes. The contrast of crisp with the hearty sauce is just fantastic. Will make it again!"

"reviewBody": "I knew by watching this recipe is would be great. I wish I could have taken a better picture but I had no idea I'd end up leaving a review because it turned out to be addictive. \n\nBut like any perfectly good recipe I can't leave it alone. Also, I don't always have exactly the same ingredients. So I used better than bouillon vegetable paste instead of beef bc that's what I had. I used less because instead of plain water I threw in some worsterchire sauce and soy sauce with that much less water. Do it to taste but be mindful of the salt. I did 2 parts worsterchire from one part soy sauce, 3 drops liquid smoke. Towards the end I added some canned mushrooms bc I needed to use them. I didn't have tots so I used mashed potatoes, and I had fresh zucchini I had to use so I lightly seasoned it and grilled that up to serve with. I tossed some chives on top from the garden and let me tell you... Amazing. \n\nI knew it would be good but had no idea it would be THIS good. The flavors completely transform and yes, the meat gets super tender so don't shy away from the tough cheaper cuts. I had elk stew meat that needed to be used and I can't imagine a better way of cooking it. The next time I will be using beef but everything else will stay the same. So so good. And so glad I was out of instant gravy mix (what as I thinking?), because it's what led me to this recipe."

These steaks were tough as leather, husband broke a tooth on it. I decided to use the remaining 2 steaks for this recipe (I was ready to throw them away). WOW! This recipe redeemed our garbage! It was delicious, tender, and now I have carte blanche to purchase terrible steaks and make them tender and delicious!"

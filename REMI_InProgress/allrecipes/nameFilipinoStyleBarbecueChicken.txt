We don't own a grill, so we used the skewers from our Ronco Showtime EZ-Store Rotisserie (yes, a cheezy appliance, but everything we've made in it has been great). This recipe's a WINNER! Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "The recipe was delicious, but more steps than the usual Chef John recipe. Make sure your banana is ripe, otherwise the green banana flavour comes through as an aftertaste. The flavour profile of marinade and basting sauce is different and both are delicious on their own. I will make this again (and again, and again)"

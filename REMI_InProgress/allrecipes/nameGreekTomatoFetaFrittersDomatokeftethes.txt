"reviewBody": "Spot on Chef- just like they taste in Greece. I added a bit of dill and reduced the mint because I only had spearmint and it's a little strong. It needed a little extra flour for me (probably because my feta was softer and my tomatoes very ripe), but fried up beautifully. They would have been even better if I could have waited until they were cool before scarfing all of them. Really appreciate this delicious, seasonal vegetarian dish! I've had mixed luck with fritters in the past and these turned out the best by far. Thank you!"

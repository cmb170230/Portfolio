It was a terrific lunch and the cheese toast was a great accompaniment. I made as written minus the fresh basil. The flavor of the soup with the anchovies had a great depth and the texture was perfect. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks, Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "Just finished eating this. It was soooo simple! I guess our tomatoes really are delicious. The soup was better than I'd imagined it could be with so few ingredients and simple steps. I used some leftover ciabatta bread made by a local restaurant, sliced it open and sprinkled a fair amount of pepper jack cheese on it topped with provolone. Since it's hot and humid these days, I didn't want to heat the oven up, so instead I broiled it in my Ninja Foodi Tendercrisp for 5 minutes. The perfect combination of crispy and soft for eating on the side of dipping into the soup. Thank you for this recipe!"

Thank you Chef John for sharing another wonderful recipe. Oh and I only used plum tomatoes because they were on sale and its winter...Still amazing"

I didn't have the bread on hand when I made it, but am definitely making more batches of this while my tomatoes ripen over the next few weeks and will make a point of making the toast too! I plan on freezing some of the soup so I can enjoy this over the next couple months!"

Tempted to freeze some for winter while field tomatoes are still in season.\n\nDo make the toast - the soup is fantastic by itself but becomes Michelin star worthy with the crispy, cheesy basil toast. Never imagined something so simple could be this flavourful. Thank you Chef John, another winner (and i didn’t use to like tomato soup; I do now!)"

I put some Tabasco, freshly ground black pepper and creme fraiche on top for serving. I will make this again next tomato season! \n\nAs for the anchovis: I think it's perfectly good without it if you want to keep it vegetarian."

I found to be rather bland so I slowly heated and stirred in some onion powder, about a half cup fresh finely diced basil, some parmesan cheese, and a half cup of whipping cream. Wow. That was a super kick up a notch an it was utterly delicious."

"reviewBody": "This was absolutely delicious! I had enough tomatoes from my garden to make a half batch, which was perfect for two people. I wish I had anchovies but I don't keep those on hand. Instead I used a couple dashes if worcestershire sauce. For the bread, I sliced up a french baggett and spread goat cheese on it and topped it with basil. The bread softens just enough when you dip it in the soup just tastes like a grown up grilled cheese and tomato soup. My hubby loved this and I will make it again. It was so easy to make everything.\nTip: if your soup is a little too acidic, add a bit of sugar to help balance it out."

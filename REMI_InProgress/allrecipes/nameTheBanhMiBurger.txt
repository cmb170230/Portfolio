"reviewBody": "Banh mi is the yummiest sandwich and among the yummiest foodstuffs in the universe. Drizzle some nuoc cham onto it. To make: mix lime juice, water &amp; sugar until it tastes like limeade with the sweetness &amp; strength you prefer; add fish sauce until it has the right balance of salty, sweet, acid &amp; umami; drop in a smashed clove of garlic &amp; some red pepper flakes or minced chili pepper. I've made banh mi on a brioche hot dog roll. The ones with the split top will toast up beautifully. I also marinate the cucumbers in a bit of sesame oil &amp; sesame seeds."

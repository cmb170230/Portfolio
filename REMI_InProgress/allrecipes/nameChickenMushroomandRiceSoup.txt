Definitely do not use more rice than in the recipe. I used half wild rice and half white rice and think I would cut back on the white rice. Even using twice the amount of broth it was very thick."

Soup was hardy and tasted great! We made extra pickled onions for on top. If you don't like picked onions or sour cream, the soup itself will need something acidic. We will be making again! :)"

"reviewBody": "The soup is amazing, but and there is always a but. Not living in the USA I have to convert from oz to grams. Very seldom do I measure my butter in cups or fractions there of. Usually I just use weight. 1/4 cup is 2 oz or 58 grams. Easy peasy. Then you start using \"sticks of butter\". Really, the imperial system isn't messed up enough for you.? Now you start using made up, industry measurements. Next we can use \"pats of butter\" 1/3 of an oz or 9.5 grams. Or a \"pin of stock\" 4 gallons of 15 litres.\n\nThat being said, your recipes are fantastic. Love to watch you cook."

Instead of using a whole chicken, I just used pieces of chicken I already had (I think a breast and maybe a couple of thighs). I also didn't have sour cream but I used a very similar substitute - labne! It really, really added to the dish. I'd like to try making the picked onions next time."

I used brown rice which took longer to cook - I think I'd cook the rice separately next time, and add at the end (which Chef John mentions in the video). Anyhow, I was the C Everett Coop of my Chicken Rice soup - and it was oh, so good!"

I did use baked chicken breast instead of boiled whole chicken to use what I already had on hand which worked great as well. I’ll admit I thought that sour cream and red wine vinegar onions were a little strange at first but they ended up being a must! The acidity from the sour cream and onion brought the soup up a notch, so good!"

I made some slight changes to suit my circumstances (e.g., added carrots, more cayenne), but that's just me cookin'.;) Keeping the chicken in large chunks is key to prevent it from breaking down into much smaller pieces when added back to the pot. Chapeau, chef!"

Be careful not to use more rice than Chef John suggests or your soup will turn to mush. This is my absolute favorite soup when made like this!"

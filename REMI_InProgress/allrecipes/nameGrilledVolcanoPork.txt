"reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe. I made a few changes due to ingredient availability. Lacking the fresh ingredients, I used dried lemongrass in place of the fresh. And, used dried New Mexico chiles, and dried arbol chiles in place of the fresh chiles. I soaked these ingredients in a little hot water to reconstitute them before adding them to the blender for the marinade. After marinating the pork for 24+ hours we cooked it on our Traeger grill. The result was tender, and delicious pork. This is a great dish! üëç üòã"

"reviewBody": "I thought this was really blah, but I think part of the problem was in the way it was served. I served this over rice as suggested and the end effect was seriously boring. The pork cooked up nicely, but it was more fragrant than flavorful for some reason - like the marinade didn't really permeate. It all felt like it needed a sauce or something."

"reviewBody": "We loved it! It was not too hot at all, but I did cheat by using bottled minced garlic and ginger. Since I follow Chef John on youtube, I am positive that he would chastise me for that. I let it marinade for 24 hours and cooked up the remaining marinade with a little extra sugar and used it on some stir fried green beans."

"reviewBody": "I made this delicious recipe but had to make some changes. I made this using cubed beef instead of the pork and did not marinate it, but rather used the marinade recipe for a sauce and simmered the beef in that for about 45 minutes before using corn starch to thicken it. It turned out great and the whole family ate it!"

I then served the pork over vermicelli rice noodles with Nam Pla Prik (fish sauce, lime, garlic, dried chilis, fresh thai chilis, palm sugar), mint, peanuts, and fried shallots. It was a perfect hot summer evening dish."

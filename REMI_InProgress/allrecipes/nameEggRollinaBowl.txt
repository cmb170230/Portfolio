I start with a combination of bell peppers (whatever I may have, and have even used all four at one time : red, green, yellow, orange). I normally use ground chicken but have also used ground pork. I haven’t tried it with tempeh yet. Shredded carrots, shredded celery, shredded savoy cabbage - have even added mushrooms and/or bean sprouts. it never disappoints. i have recently taken to adding hot chili oil to the sauce for spicy egg roll in a bowl. Delish. And extra wonton strips are a must!"

"reviewBody": "My vegetarian daughter was visiting so we eliminated the pork and we both agreed it was the most delicious meal I've made in a long time!!! Since I had left-over ingredients after she went home, I made it with the pork and again, one of the most delicious meals I've made in a long time!!! Would highly recommend!!! We baked the noodles and had a little trouble keeping them from burning (didn't watch them closely enough) so the next time, I fried them in oil in a saute pan where I could watch, turn and remove before they burned - for me a much better process!!! Again, would highly recommend this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Delicious with just the right amount of kick. Followed the recipe as written except to lower the fat content I used hot turkey sausage and sprayed the wonton strips with Olive Oil Pam instead of tossing with oil before baking. Did not use the optional sake. Had planned to just buy cole slaw mix for this recipe but was guilted into shredding all the vegetables myself by Chef John (see video) and, of course, he was right. Will always make this recipe from scratch, if possible. The freshness is worth the extra time."

The sauce looked scant when I poured it in the pan, but there was plenty. I mixed the sauce in the morning so at dinner time it only took 10 minutes to ready this dish. Egg roll in a Bowl will be in the regular rotation from now on."

"reviewBody": "Loved this recipe!! But you definitely need to double - and, since I like cabbage, almost (but not quite) tripled that ingredient. I added chopped sweet onion to the pork sauté and used both red and yellow peppers. While they turned out; I am not very good at cutting julienne carrots! Will need to use my chopper to get them more finely sliced and consistent in size. I omitted the wonton aspect; I didn’t have any and wasn’t running to the store. I didn’t feel like I was missing out!\n\nMy husband chowed it down so fast I actually thought he missed eating lunch! Awesome recipe - keto or not! Plan to make again and again!"

I was hoping the won ton strips would make it something special, but they didn't really add much \"egg roll\" flavor, only some crunch. I subbed seasoned tofu for the pork. Making the strips took some time as they all stuck together when I tossed them in oil, then had to peel them apart and individually lay them on the baking pan. Unlike other Chef John recipes, I won't be making this again. At least it was healthy!"

I used prepackaged fried wonton strips because that’s all my grocery delivery service had, but that made it even easier and didn’t take much away from the flavor. (Though I imagine freshly made would be very good!) I used a full pound of pork and couldn’t find my cornstarch so cooked the sauce a bit longer to reduce it. I will definitely be making again!"

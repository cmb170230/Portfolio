The rice is so good, and the chicken generally tender, with a delicious baked-in marinade of savory and baking spices, with the cinnamon and cardamom standing out in particular. I marinated for 4 hours but will probably do the full 8 hours or so next time. I also may just buy a cut-up chicken, as I don't really enjoy the messy process of cutting it up myself. Finally, I'll double the delicious yogurt sauce."

This was the first time I've bought saffron... I'm not sure how much of the rice flavour comes from being cooked with chicken broth, or the saffron, or being baked with the chicken, but oh my - the rice was heavenly! this recipe is a keeper, along with all of the others I have tried from Chef John so far. Also, A++++ for his videos. Love listening to his voice cadence and his jokes!"

"reviewBody": "I've made this recipe four times now, and while it does take some time, it's very much worth it. Using a glass casserole dish allows the fat from the pieces of chicken to drain to the bottom resulting in a crunchy, tahdig- like rice. It's so delicious that I always double the recipe in order to insure leftovers. And don't forget the pita bread!"

I mistakenly used non-fat yogurt, so the chicken itself didn't have much flavor, but I balanced it after when making the yogurt mix to go on to top of the cooked chicken by adding honey, and it was perfect. I also cooked the rice and chicken separately, since I have never done a rice casserole and was afraid to get mooshie rice"

The top of the rice does get a touch crunchy in parts. Not my thing, but I didn’t hate it (I thought I might). I liked the sauce but also don’t find it necessary. The chicken and rice have great flavor on their own. Thanks for something a little different to put in rotation."

I made it with three large quarters instead of a complete chicken, nearly three pounds of meat, but will try a fourth quarter next time. I had enough extra marinade to spoon it onto my quarters after laying them in the rice."

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and thighs. I would recommend checking the chicken at about 35 minutes. Mine came out a little dry but it was my fault. I also used oat yogurt and it actually worked well. Thanks!"

The only changes I make is to halve to recipe, add a can of corn and a sprinkling of dried onion flakes. Thanks Chef John!"

I did not change a thing except I cut the recipe in half as there is only the two of us. I do think that using the kidney beans is a must as I think any other bean would not taste as \"meaty\" as the red kidney bean. I also feel the cilantro and yogurt is needed to make this so Mexican like. Thank you again, Chef John....it is now on my list to make often."

I have made this twice in the past 3 weeks and will continue to make it regularly. I used whole grain brown rice instead because we only eat whole grain so I had to cook it for 2 1/2 - 2 hrs. 45 minutes. I will add a little more broth next time. I used mild salsa the first time and it was perfect. The 2nd time I used medium salsa but we all liked it better with the mild. I also skipped the cayenne so it wasn't too spicy for my daughter. I cooked it in a ceramic dutch oven with a lid."

Also added 1/4 cup diced garlic that I pre-cooked on the stovetop with the butter and a splash of red wine vinegar, and added that at the \"toss with oil\" stage. Also added 2 cups of corn. To serve: shredded Monterey jack &amp; cheddar, sliced avocadoes, sour cream, green onions, and fresh cilantro."

We’ve also made an Indian inspired version using chickpeas and replacing the chili powder with garam masala and curry and adding golden raisins."

This recipe has calls for more rice than broth, and even with the salsa and oil falls short of what is needed to provide enough moisture for the rice. Adjust rice/liquid ratio to the back of the rice package guide for better results. Beans were fine. Seasoning may be OK if enough liquid is used."

Added more chicken broth and salsa. 1 hr, 30 min in the rice still had a little crunch. Took it out of the pyrex and spread it out more into a 13x9 and added yet more liquid. After more than 2 hrs the rice was still not completely done and the dish was dry. Im not sure what else I could have done. It had good flavor, though. I may try making this again using different rice and less of it. I used the exact ingredients but half of all to start. Im open to suggestions as to what went wrong. I'm a pretty decent cook normally."

"reviewBody": "We have made this dish about 10x since Chef John posted his video. It is absolutely a staple for us now and it never gets old! Since there are two of us, we can get 3 meals out of this one. The first night we have it as-is, the 2nd night we have it in tortillas, and the 3rd night we eat it like dip, with tortilla chips, sour cream, and guacamole. I've made this dish with short grain rice (calrose) and I don't have to adjust the liquids or cooking time. It comes out perfect! I've also made it with homemade beans instead of canned (black and pinto) and it's wonderful. The only consistent substitution we make is to use a can of Rotel for the salsa, which gives it even more heat. I just dump the Rotel in a 2 cup measuring cup and fill it with a little extra water until it hits the 16 ounce line, since this recipe calls for 16 ounces of salsa. It's perfect every single time. I can't recommend this one enough-- the flavors are better then any other beans &amp; rice dish I've tried, and baking the beans and rice give the dish a superior texture vs. stove top."

I skipped the cayenne pepper and used only a teaspoon of chili powder because I can’t take that much heat. I checked it after about 45 minutes, and most of the rice was cooked and plump, except for a layer lying under the beans and salsa in the center of the dish. I gave it another 15 or 20 minutes and the rice in the center was done. Like one other reviewer said, the finished product seemed like too much rice in proportion to the beans and salsa. I may use only a cup of rice if I make it again. I have enough ingredients since I bought enough to make the whole recipe. Spices were good. I hoped it wouldn’t be too salty, since I used 2 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon to make the 2 cups of broth. Nope, not too salty. I’m glad I cut the recipe in half this first time making it."

Adding oil and tossing it with the rice to evenly coat each grain before cooking really kept the rice nice and light and separated, not clumpy."

The only other comment like many of the other reviewers this must have a tight Aluminum foil around the edge and even then I would add an extra 1/4 cup of water. This recipe was printed out and put in my binder of ten out of ten go to recipes that are fast ,easy, healthy and inexpensive to make."

"reviewBody": "This was delicious. I halved the recipe and cooked in a 9x9 glass dish. I used Better Than Bouillon and water since I didn't have any chicken broth. I also used a little paprika along with the ground chili pepper and other spices (my husband added cayenne at the table). We had only about a third of a 16 oz jar of salsa (need to buy more!) but I think next time I will add tomatoes or Rotel because that wasn't enough. It turned out a little dry but that was probably because my foil didn't seal tightly enough. Added can of black beans to the leftovers and have more than enough for another meal. Also used Fage yogurt and cheddar cheese for the toppings. Chef John, I've been making your sourdough bread for 2 months - it's super with black olives and the discard makes great crackers."

My family loved it and has requested it again. \nI substituted some of the ingredients by using organic brown long grain rice (2.5 cups), vegetable broth, Rotel, crush tomatoes (15 oz) and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper. I initially cooked it for 1 hour and 30 minutes however the rice was still hard. I added the remaining vegetable broth (16 oz in total) to add more moisture and cooked the dish an additional 40 minutes. I let it rest for approximately 15 minutes with the aluminum foil tightly sealed before fluffing the rice mixture with chopped cilantro. Delicious!!"

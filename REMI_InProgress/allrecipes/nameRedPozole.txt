"reviewBody": "The flavor was very nice. A for sure upgrade to my Mom’s version of the recipe she puts together in under 45 minutes. The time put in to cooking the pork was definitely worth it. I had to add a lot more water into the stew than what was mentioned in the recipe since it was reducing so much. At the end I should of added even more water. I never have had pigs feet before and this was a good way to get me to try them, they worked well. Thanks chef John. Oh yeah, that is a Food Wishes margarita."

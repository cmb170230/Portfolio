I think my pallet likes to party! ;) So, the second time, I doubled the cheddar cheese, added celery, minced garlic and then added a lot more Worcestershire to taste. It brought it up to 5 stars for me. I'd make it again, but would continue to spruce it up a bit. My husband devoured the modified version!"

Also, the potato chips will get soggy when you refrigerate the leftover. To me that's not a big problem unless you want to freeze. Then you might want to go the breadcrumb route."

Added a dollop of sour cream, and a bit of cream cheese, a dollop of mayo, and a bit of creme fraishe, which basically cleaned off my fridge door. 3 cans of really outdated tuna fish, and had enough frozen peas and carrots languishing in the freezer as well. On to the pantry, where I combined panko , regular, and Italian bread crumbs. Was a little short, so I crumbled up some ritz crackers to make the mark. Added 2 cloves garlic to the filling as well. Very delicious, richer than the published recipe, and the garlic I think this casserole needs. Everyone gobbled it up,, and the best part, I had a whole trashcan full of empty containers! Nice! I grew up poor as you can be, and I refuse to waste a scrap of food. Thanks Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "I made this exactly as the recipe called except for one addition. I added fresh mushrooms into the butter instead of onions because my husband doesn't like onions. He can tolerate onion powder and pureed onion. I added a little extra cayenne, but everything else was as called for in the recipe. I actually took it out of the oven at 25 minutes and let it rest for 10 minutes. There was enough sauce that some of it was trying to bubble out of the side, but it was very little. The casserole was delicious. My husband enjoyed it as well. I gave it four stars because I added to the original recipe with the mushrooms and it actually began to be a little bit dryer than we would have liked. I will make this again, but will most likely either add more sauce or cook it for less time. 20 minutes might actually do it. It was definitely a golden brown, if not a little darker when I removed it. I'm attaching pictures."

"reviewBody": "I agree with Mousielove, JohnL and Tashagang. This recipe works equally well with chicken. , but I would use frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas. That's the beauty of these recipes, you work with what you've got. Speaking of which, I almost always put chopped or finely sliced celery in my casseroles and try to have a jar or two of minced pimientos around for taste and color. Lastly, I can't stand the Tuna in Water and, if you buy a good brand, packed in olive oil. you can drain it off and use it in the topping."

"reviewBody": "Not Mrs. Kotter's tuna casserole! This was great. I had an open bottle of white wine, so I used the last of it (~2/3 cup) in place of some of the milk, and it added a really nice bit of acidity. I added the wine to the roux and let it cook for few seconds so it wouldn't curdle the milk, and then whisked in the milk. This makes a huge batch, which was fine because the leftovers are delicious, but I think next time I'll try a half recipe. I only had water-packed tuna and it was fine."

Used mix of Parmigiano Regiano and Pecorino Romano for crumb topping, and increased quantities by 50% for larger area pan. COVID-19, ya know. Delicious! Gave only 4 stars as I changed the recipe a bit.\nAs CJ says. \"That's just you cooking.\""

"reviewBody": "Tuna noodle casserole is one of my absolute favorite meals. I had all the ingredients except one, which was the Parmigiano-Reggiano and I could not for the life of me find it at the store. So I used more bread crumbs in place of that. I used whole milk and did not find any tuna in olive oil (only water and vegetable) so I used tuna in water. As far as how it turned out it is good but not quite great. I do like my tuna casserole pretty moist so next time I think I'll add more liquid to the ratio. Oh, I did add an extra 1/4 cup of peas because I love peas, doubly so in my tuna casserole. The consistency before baking was pretty on par with what Chef John shows in the video. I am a notoriously picky eater but I am enjoying the results of this recipe so I'll likely try it again with a few custom tweaks."

Not the King of casseroles, but Chef John's Macaroni and Cheese IS the King. of casseroles. Next time, will grate cheese beforehand, hopefully, if it's available. Thanks, Chef John."

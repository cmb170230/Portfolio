"reviewBody": "This looked really good and I finally got around to making it. I did switch it up by using bbq sauce instead of hot sauce and white cheddar instead of the blue cheese. Also, I pre-heated my oven and so I put the pan into a hot oven instead of the cold oven (just mis-read the recipe). Still came out really good. I will be making this again with the buffalo style and also will freelance and try other combinations."

I'd love to hear about how to make a breakfast version. I'm trying to imagine how that works. Soft scramble eggs with browned sausage and cheese, then add that to the middle? I'm going to try it!"

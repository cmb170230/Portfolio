"reviewBody": "I love this recipe, I did have to make a few alterations. Because I used frozen Early Girl tomatoes I felt that it was runny, so I cooked it for a lot longer. Also since I am allergic to garlic, I used onions. I did not have the red pepper flakes so I used chili powder. then I cooked it for approx. 2 hours. It smells wonderful and fresh. I plan on freezing it, and using it to make spaghetti or pizza sauce. 15 lbs of tomatoes made me 10 cups of sauce!"

"reviewBody": "Trying to press cooked tomatoes through a sieve or colander is a clumsy ineffective process. Most of the solids remain behind leaving nothing but a thin liquid that will be impossible to reduce. Using a food mill is far superior. More importantly the recipe yields a most unremarkable bland tasting product."

"reviewBody": "I liked this sauce and its pure tomato flavor but like the one I regularly make just a little better. It calls for the addition of a cup of minced sautéed onion and 2 tsps of sugar to 15 lbs of tomatoes. Otherwise, it's close. To address the question of freezing fresh sauce - I've done it and it's just not as good later. The sauce separates in the freezer and develops ice crystals. Canning the sauce preserves that fresh from the garden flavor. 15 lbs of a variety of tomatoes yields about 4 quarts. If you decide to process and jar your sauce, you'll need to add 1/2 tsp of citric acid per qt jar. Love your recipes Chef John!"

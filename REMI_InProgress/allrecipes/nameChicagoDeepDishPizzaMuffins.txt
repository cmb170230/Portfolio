I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it tasted on my first try. It was super hard to roll the pizza dough, so next time, I'll roll the dough, let it rest and roll it some more."

"reviewBody": "Made these tonight and was super thrilled with how they turned out ! My muffins browned up a bit quicker than the 30-35 minutes baking time specified by Chef John. That's why mine have a slightly darker colour compared to Chef John's own batch in the video. Regardless I loved how these came out, and will be making another batch for a party soon !"

They took some work, and because I only own one muffin pan, I only made 12. Everyone in the house was disappointed in me! In fact, I'm going out today to buy two more pans just to make more of these. I even used store bought refrigerated pizza dough and jar sauce, and it was still amazing! I followed the recipe and used sausage and peppers, but I think using diced pepperoni would change all of our lives! I cannot thank you enough for bringing this recipe into our lives!"

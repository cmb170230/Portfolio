It does have a different taste than traditional chili but still has a good rich flavor. I was worried because after thirty minutes of simmering it tasted blah, but went the full hour and a half to a nice, dark thickness and the flavors really came together nicely. Thank you Chef!"

The only change I made was that I used Gebhardt Chili Powder. That was because there was a famous place in CA that used it and celebrities in the 40's used to order the chili from there for all of their sets. I don't think they are wrong. But use what chili powder you have."

I didn't have the full 1-1.5 hours to simmer so I only used 1/3 the water and simmered for a half hour, and I didn't have the allspice. I also added the cocoa powder. It was, hands down, the BEST chili I've ever had. We loved the tastes of all the spices and the depth they added. Adding a generous amount of fresh onions to the finished chili is definitely a must as well. This is going to be my go-to chili from now on"

I am hoping my issue was a 'lost in translation' problem.\n\n1/4 cup of chili powder? \n\nI always follow the instructions exactly, the first time I make it. Then I can adjust. \n\nI knew by the smell that, this was too spicy for me. Once the ridiculously small spoon hit my mouth I was reaching for a drink.\n\nMy daughter who loves spicy thought it was ok, but lacked depth of flavor because all she could taste was chili powder."

It smelled really good, but I think the spaghetti and cheese just didn't work with it. I kind of feel it needed some green olives in there for a few salt bombs. Maybe serve over spaghetti squash or something."

I have never made a \"4 way\" without a Gold Star or Skyline seasoning packet, but I don't have any. This is a good alternative. My husband, who was born in Cleveland and had many a Skyline and Gold Star, told me, \"Don't forget that recipe! It's delicious!\" It's been a long time since I've seen him eat that much and put the leftovers in the fridge! (You ladies know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) Thanks, Chef John!\n02/03/2020 My husband has requested this made again today! He loves this recipe!"

"reviewBody": "Fantastic! Great to see you put out this staple of the Queen City. First off, the thicker chili makes it really versatile for making awesome chili cheese coneys (don't forget to add mustard and onions), or as a topping for potatoes or loaded french fries. Pro tip: cook the beef just in water for about 20 minutes. Then put it in a bowl and throw in the fridge overnight. This causes all the fat to rise to the top and solidify so you can easily scoop it off with a spoon. Then return to your pot with all the components for a nice slow simmer. Finally, I like to add a tbs of cocoa powder to the chili while simmering. This city was known for its German heritage but this one is a shout out to our Greek immigrants. Enjoy!"

I like to go back and forth between the Cincinnati version and the Skyline version. All that needs to be done is for Skyline is add 1 oz of unsweet chocolate and eliminate the chili powder."

Simmering the sauce at medium-low wasn't enough heat to make it get thick. After an hour, it was still very watery. I cranked it up to medium-high heat, and that did the trick.\nI read some other recipes and saw that many folks put in some chocolate. So I put in 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. There are so many flavors happening, I don't know if it made much difference. But it sure didn't hurt!"

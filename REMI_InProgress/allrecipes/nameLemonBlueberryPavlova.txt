I wish I’d been a little more patient and whisked the egg whites a little longer because they weren’t quite stiff enough. However, the pavlova went over well. It’s a dreamy dessert."

You must absolutely try this recipe! I made it for an Australian friend, and he said it 100% authentic. I did add other berries and kiwi fruit along with the blueberries, but it was an absolute hit with the party guests. I will be making this again!"

"reviewBody": "This dessert was a huge hit at Easter! I've admired the pavlovas I'd seen on a certain british baking show for years, but I never imagined that I could make one. It just seemed beyond my very average baking ability. I should have known that Chef John would demystify this dessert and make creating it possible. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow just as written. The only thing that I did differently was that I traced the bottom of a spring form pan onto my parchment paper, then flipped it (so the outline could be seen through the paper, but we didn't eat graphite) so I could get a perfect circle of merengue. I otherwise followed the directions exactly and it came out beautiful and delicious! If you're \"merengue-curious\", I would absolutely urge you to try this."

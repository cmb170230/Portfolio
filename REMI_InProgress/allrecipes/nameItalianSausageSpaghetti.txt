"reviewBody": "Really great. The payoff in flavor for the minimal effort is mind blowing. If you watch the video and pay attention to the little hints that the chef shares then making it is a breeze. I used rigatoni instead of a long spaghetti and it made a very hearty dish. The only other changes was that it called for a larger bottle of sauce then they seem to be selling now. I decided to up the sausage and use two jars of sauce. I figured I could sauce the pasta with what I needed and save the rest for another time. In the end it worked with a pound of rigatoni and really didn't leave extra sauce. Nobody minded eating a little extra sausage either. The recipe calls for one link or four pieces per person, but I think that would be good for a pasta course in a big meal. For a main course the extra sausage wasn't overkill. Since it's mostly hands off simmering this recipe is a keeper for a nice family meal without being stuck over the stove the whole time."

"reviewBody": "Don't let the simplicity of this dish fool you -- it turns out as tasty as if you'd slaved for hours. I use sweet Italian turkey sausage to cut down fat, and add a sprinkle of cayenne and fennel seed to the cooking meat. Finally, I use a top-quality marinara sauce because I don't want to compromise the dish just to save $2-3. Judging by the silence from the dinner table, the results are worth it."

"reviewBody": "My husband showed me this recipe because he read your writeup about it and was interested in the ease of use with the jar of marinara sauce in conjunction with Italian sausage over ground beef. I couldn't find links of Italian sausage, so I used ground Italian sausage in place of it. Honestly, it's incredibly delicious. The white wine was a nice touch, and reducing down for 90 minutes was key. It's a little high on the sodium levels, but for the tastiness of the dish it's absolutely worth it."

Well I stand corrected. \n Chef John's recipe is everything he said. The white wine deglazing adds a subtle flavor enhancement and the sweet Italian sausage truly takes on the texture of meatballs once they've simmered in the sauce for 60 - 90 minutes. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised by this meal."

The sausage was firm but tender, and the premade sauce was really enhanced by the simmering time.\n\nThe only change I would make is NOT generously seasoning the pasta water. It might vary per brand of sausage and tomato sauce, but I found that even without adding any salt to the sauce itself, it ended up being a bit too salty. Your mileage may vary."

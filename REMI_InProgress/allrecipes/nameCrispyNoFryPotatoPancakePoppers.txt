"reviewBody": "I followed 95% of the directions except (1) I had a third potato so I decided to use it and it was a good decision because the muffin tin filled up much better, (2) added onion powder because garlic and onions are friends, (3) upped the cayenne to a heaping 1/2 tsp. Baked with convection. It turned out so crisp and delicious! Will definitely make again. Spices are very adjustable too! Thank you Chef John."

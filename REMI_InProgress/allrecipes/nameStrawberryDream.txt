All three turned out beautifully and not a bite was left by any of my guests. This picture is my raspberry version."

"reviewBody": "I've made this twice now. First time, it was a bit too soft - I think because I had my temperature set too low for the 5 minute cook time. Only change I made in the recipe was in the order of operations. I cut up the entire quart of strawberries and covered them with the 2 T of sugar and then after the hour of maceration, just reserved the 2/3 cup for topping. Also, this is super rich. Can easily reduce serving size and pour into 5 dishes instead of 4. Finally, it took one large lemon to make 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Now I'm wondering how this would taste with other fruits. Looking forward to experimenting."

"reviewBody": "This \"posset\" is really delicious. However. Once I strained the seeds and froth out of the puree, I discovered that I had almost nothing left. The cream was cooling, and I didn't have time to let another batch of strawberries macerate for an hour, so I had to quickly improvise. I cooked some chopped strawberries and sugar and water, and then used the immersion blender on them, strained the puree into a small bowl and placed that bowl into a larger bowl full of ice to cool it down. Then I had plenty of puree for the 4 servings. \n\nI also added diced strawberries in the bottom of the glass, in the puree layer. \n\nI'm definitely going to make this again. \n\nAlso, I might like some pound cake in it, cut into cubes and put in the glass, making it have more textures.\n\nAgain, this was really enjoyable. Light, fresh, lovely. Thanks, Chef John!\n(And I like to say the word \"posset\" so I said it a lot tonight.)"

This recipe made 4 3/4 cup servings with purée and 1 extra 3/4 cup serving of just the cream mixture which I served with the diced strawberries. Yumm!"

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a blender instead of the recommended immersion blender, so when I strained the mixture there was virtually no pulp or seeds to remove. I used mason jars for presentation, which also allowed me to easily stack them in the fridge."

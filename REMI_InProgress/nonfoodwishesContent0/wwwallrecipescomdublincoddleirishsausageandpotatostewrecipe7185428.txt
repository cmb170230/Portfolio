  Dublin Coddle – Welcome Home  

As the story goes, this adorably named dish would be prepared early in the evening by one spouse, and left to slowly simmer on the stove, or "coddle," while the other spouse was enjoying a pint or three at the pub. After the barkeep would say something like, "You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here," they would head back to enjoy a big bowl of Dublin Coddle.



And yes, that was the modern, neutral gender role version, and I suspect that 99.7% of the time the wife would've been the maker, and the husband would've been the drinker/late-night eater. Nevertheless, it sounds like quite a system, and maybe a tradition we could develop here in America. I mean, coming home to microwaved Hot Pockets just isn't the same thing. Whether that happens or not, and spoiler alert, it will not, this is one of the most amazing stews in existence, no matter when it's enjoyed.



The secret here is a very long, slow cook, which can be done on the stovetop, as described above, or in the oven, which is how I prefer to do it. By the way, apparently there's the "white" version, where everything is just dumped into a pot of water and simmered to perfection, or the "brown" version, where some or all of the meat is browned first. While not as traditional, I believe the second method looks and tastes better, so that's what I went with. This is a truly great bowl of food, and whether you enjoy it after a few stouts or not, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!












Ingredients



8 strips thick-cut bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces


2 tablespoons butter


2 yellow onions, chopped


4 cloves garlic, minced


1 cup chopped green onions, plus more to garnish top


1 cup stout beer


1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves


1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley


freshly ground black pepper, to taste


2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste


pinch cayenne


3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and halved


4 cups chicken broth


6 large pork sausage links, about 2 1/2 pounds total






Directions




Cook bacon in a Dutch oven or a large oven-safe pot with a lid over medium heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Add butter, onions, and pinch of salt, and cook until onions are soft and translucent. Add garlic, and green onions, and cook stirring for 2 minutes.





Pour in beer, raise heat to high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beer has reduced by about 75%. While beer is reducing, season with thyme, parsley, black pepper, salt, and pinch cayenne. Once beer has reduced, add potatoes and broth and bring to a simmer.





Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).





Prick sausage on both sides, and add to the pot on top of the other ingredients.





Cover and place pot into the preheated oven. Cook for about 2 1/2 hours. Remove the lid, and continue cooking uncovered for about 1 more hour.





Remove from oven and skim excess fat from top before serving. Garnish top with green onions, if desired.











Dublin Coddle.
Chef John


   Cook's Notes:  

Stew can be simmered gently on the stove instead of cooked in the oven.


Any raw pork sausage can be used. Serve with Irish soda bread.

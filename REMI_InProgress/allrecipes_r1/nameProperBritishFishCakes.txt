"reviewBody": "I had some issues but the cakes were tasty. I didn’t care for the tartar sauce, seems like it needs more acid or something. Also I had issues getting the mixture the hold together, wonder if it would do better with an egg? Since I was having these issues I just cooked them like plain patties and skipped the breading steps. And they were good! So I think you can skip the breading if desired and just give patties of the mixture a few minutes per side in a hot skillet."

"reviewBody": "Another fine recipe from a fellow American, teaching us how to be like the Brits :). I used pollock because I was having difficulty finding cod. It was still fantastic. Also had no capers on hand, so followed another poster's example and subbed chopped dill pickles in the tartar sauce. Beautiful! That fresh tarragon btw, was the next-most expensive item on the grocery list for this reicpe, following the fish. It tasted great but I may omit it next time, as there are few recipes in which I could use that leftover tarragon, thus, it will probably go to waste. Perhaps fresh dill would be the right sub. for tarragon?"

"reviewBody": "Your recipe was outstanding! I made them tonight and used my deep fryer. I figured I'd get a more evenly cooked cake. Tarter is something I'm always struggling with but this one was a perfect fit. I will probably make this tarter for other fish recipes as well. Thanks for making our Friday night fish fry the best one we've had in quite a while."

"reviewBody": "I didn't have cod but I had 500g of frozen hake so I used that. I also think I used too many potatoes because the mixture made 10 patties. However, they were delicious. Mine were a bit soft and falling apart, but the flavour was excellent. It may also be because I crowded my pan. I also used gherkins in place of capers, as I had none. I feel this made the best tartar I have ever had. Thank you so much Chef John."

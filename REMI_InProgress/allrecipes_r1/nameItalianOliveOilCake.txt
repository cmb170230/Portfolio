"reviewBody": "Really, really good. A quick cake to mix up for a weeknight! I baked it as an upside-down cake in a 10-inch cake pan lined with parchment. I soaked Trader Joe's dried orange slices in hot water (I added the soaking liquid to the cake batter) and arranged them in the bottom of the pan with some candied rosemary sprigs. Baking time was a little less - maybe 45 minutes? I used an instant-read thermometer and pulled the cake at 210 degrees F."

"reviewBody": "This was a very satisfying recipe for my first cake project. A simple rustic breakfast cake. The olive oil ingredient, combined with canola oil, instead of using butter, appealed to my Mediterranean wife. She also liked that I only used one cup of sugar, instead of one and three-quarters, making the cake still very delicious. I really like the decoration with the powdered sugar, but can't figure out how it is applied so fanciful, perhaps with a stencil."

"reviewBody": "Chef John delivers. Easy to make cake, with yummy results ‚ú® Decided to use a bundt cake instead and it worked out just fine. Also ran out of baking power üò≠, but substituting the 1 tsp baking power with 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp white vinegar did the trick in a pinch. We made Chef John's raspberry sauce to go with it, and the contrast with the citrus flavor in the cake was lovely. Appreciated the tip about using the cooling rack over the cake for an ornate powdered sugar look üëèüèº"

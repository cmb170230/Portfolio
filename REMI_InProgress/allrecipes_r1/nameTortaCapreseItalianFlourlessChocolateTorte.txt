The one issue I had: my 8 inch cake pan wasn't as deep as Chef John's; I narrowly avoided overflow. It wasn't the prettiest torte, but it was delicious! I highly recommend!"

"reviewBody": "Gave it 5 Stars because the cake was amazing and the one step egg whipping is such a work/time saver. However, how flourless is a \"Flourless Chocolate Torte\" when step one is to butter and flour a pan? Silly Chef John! LOL I used cocoa powder instead to prepare the pan by running it around the inside, around the inside...of a well buttered and papered cake pan and it worked great and maintained the rich chocolatey color as well. Made my wheat allergic Valentine's sweetie very happy."

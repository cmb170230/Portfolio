,"text": "Serve immediately in hot cups, garnished with a pinch of cayenne on top if desired. Cook&#39;s Notes: This is the thinner, drinkable version of Spanish-Style Hot Chocolate. For the thicker, richer version, used for dipping churros, increase the cornstarch from 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon, and increase the chocolate amount from 4 ounces to 6 ounces. If semi-sweet chocolate is used instead of dark, bittersweet chocolate, the white sugar amount may need to be reduced, according to taste."

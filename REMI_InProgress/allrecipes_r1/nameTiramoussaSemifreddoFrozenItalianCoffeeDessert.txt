Whisk constantly until mixture thickens and drippings from the whisk form ribbons on the surface that are visible for 1/2 second to 1 second, about 10 minutes. If you are &#34;brave&#34;, you can set the bowl directly over medium-low heat and thicken the egg cream that way, but you have to be careful so you don&#39;t end up with scrambled eggs. This last method is slightly faster and will take about 6 to 7 minutes."

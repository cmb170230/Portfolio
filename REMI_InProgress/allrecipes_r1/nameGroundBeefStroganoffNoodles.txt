"reviewBody": "Chef John is usually great and this meal was a favorite of my college boyfriend's family, good memories. So, since you mentioned Hamburger Helper, I remembered a funny story from college. My dorm roommate invited me for dinner at her summer apartment, near where she was working during summer break. She cooked a Hamburger Helper concoction, but forgot to drain the grease from the cheap cut of ground beef meat ( we were students!) It resulted with a layer of fat about a 1/2 inch thick, so neither of us could eat it! We were a couple of 20 year olds &amp; laughed hard and got a pizza with coupons! Still laugh about it!"

"reviewBody": "I made this last night and it was great! Only changed when I cooked a couple of ingredients. I put a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper in the oil when cooking the hamburger along with minced garlic. Held the onions out until I drained the hamburg partially cooked then added them and finished as I did not want mushy onions. I am not sure what the vodka did but there was a nice cutting taste to the meal. Really enjoyed it and warmed up another bowl for lunch today. I will be making this again."

"reviewBody": "Fantastic recipe; far superior to that stuff out of the red box yet similar enough to be sentimental! Important: The video does a great job of what to look for before taking the next step. Let that be your guide because the times given here might be wildly off depending on your heat control, ingredients, etc. I went straight broth instead of broth+water because my stuff was that cheap beef water in a box. I added a little bullion and Worcestershire too, just to shore things up. Subbed white wine per CJ's recommendation because I didn't have any vodka. Came out great! Very easy, just took a little longer than I thought. It will be a little loose when its done, but just like the OG hamburger helper it thickens up just right after a few minutes of cool down."

I used thicker Kluski egg noodles because my husband doesn't care for regular egg noodles. These take longer to cook so I ended up adding quite a bit more beef broth. I used green onions on top. Definitely make this in a pan that has high sides with a lid. Mine was non-stick so I didn't have fond on the bottom to speak of, but it really didn't seem to matter much. Both of us really liked it and I will definitely make it again."

I hate when people write how they changed a recipe but I added a tiny touch of Dijon, paprika, and worcestershire. I loved that this used ground beef and you cook the noodles in the broth, adds even more flavor into the noodles! Definitely adding it into my rotation!"

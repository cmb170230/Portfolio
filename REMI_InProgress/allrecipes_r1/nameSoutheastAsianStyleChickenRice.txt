"reviewBody": "Had chicken thighs in the fridge so used those. Subbed Thai chilies for the Fresno and Sriracha for the hot chili sauce. It was a lot spicier than I thought but with my subs I should have seen it coming. Even with those substitutions it was so good I had seconds in spite of trying to cut back on eating until I'm stuffed. Thanks Chef John!"

"reviewBody": "This was such a delicious and simple weeknight dinner! The flavor of the rice was fantastic with all the chickeny goodness. I didn't have mint so I used some parsley but the freshness of the herbs really elevated the chicken. The husband was apprehensive but was pleasantly surprised (even if he did add soy sauce). This will definitely be on the dinner rotation since it feeds two people with one chicken breast. Thanks, Chef John!"

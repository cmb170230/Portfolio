The filling is a little sweet on its own but when paired with the bun and unsweetened whipped cream, there is a great balance of sweetness. Next time I would put the buns closer to the top of the oven to achieve better browning. The husband and the sister were very impressed and I will definitely be making these again. Thanks, Chef John!"
